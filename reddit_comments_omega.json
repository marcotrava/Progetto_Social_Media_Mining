(meant as a compliment as i enjoy transformers) definitely not the typical aqua terra everyone else is wearing and makes for a great conversation piece.\nlove me some tudor and that navy blue is my absolute favorite color. if that pelagos had a date feature my other watches would be in serious trouble as i could easily see that as a gada one watch for me.",

(it's barely more than 0.25 seconds off, so i rounded up.)\n\nmy #2 would be the jlc.  that master ultra thin date blue is really, really cool.  it's an uncommon shade of blue.   if you're looking for a dress watch, that would be my #1 choice.  i also like the moon version, which is a brighter blue.  either is great for a dressy watch.\n\ni happen to loooooove the seamaster black lacquer, but once getting away from that dial i'd stick with one of your other options.  i do love both the yellow and orange options too though.\n\nbig piece of advice: put them all on your wrist before deciding.  do it over a couple weekends and really consider this carefully.  do not buy them sight unseen.  \n\ni wasn't in the market for a watch when i bought my gs.  a buddy was checking them out and i just went along for the experience.  they happened to have the 019 in their display case and when i put it on my wrist... it just pressed all the right buttons.  even so, i went home and thought about it further, then returned the next weekend and asked to see it in natural light at the front of the store.  (store lights tend to really overstate the beauty of watch details.)  since i own it now, you can see how that went...\n\nby the way, if you're in southern california the hyde park / 1916 store in fashion island has a really good selection to check out.",

anything else on the market.\n\nif you like these updates, and would maybe like to subscribe to the newsletter so you get them in your inbox every day, you can do so by [clicking

spectacular**](https://baltic-watches.com/en?utm_source=itsabouttime.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=this-is-the-new-baltic-prismic-and-it-s-absolutely-spectacular-omega-updates-the-41mm-constellation-with-meteorite-dials-vulcain-releases-the-grand-prix-new-from-minase-and-revolution-x-minase)\n\nwhen a brand has a fantastic year, like baltic had in 2023, there are only two things that can happen - they can either have a slump year or go even harder and outdo everythign they\u2019ve done in 2023. and they\u2019ve done a lot. there was the brilliant new herm\u00e9tique tourer line, their incredible colorful take on the field watch. they updated their classic watches - the mr01, hms 002 and bicompax 002 - in a wonderful gold/black colorway. and they introduced the incredible experiments premier quatri\u00e8me perp\u00e9tual, a perpetual calendar that was part of the brand new line of haute horology watches and was supposed to be auctioned off at only watch. \n\nseeing as how we\u2019re in februrary, and baltic is introducing a brand new collection, they are going for the latter of the two options - going harder and outdoing 2023. the new collection is called prismic, made up of four super-thin watches with incredible colors and even better shapes and refractions. no wonder, seeing as how the collection is inspired by the geometric shapes and luminous refractions of a prism. \n\nstarting off with the case, it gives away the prismic\u2019s intent. sure, it takes on the shape of a traditional dress watch, but baltic points out that they went more in the \u201ccocktail\u201d watch direction with the flashy dials and actually complicated case construction. the case comes in at 36mm wide, just 9,2mm thick (an even svelter 7,4mm without the double domed crystal) and has a lug-to-lug of 44mm - all together an incredibly wearable offering. the case is made of five distinct parts with different finishes and materials - the bezel, lugs and caseback are made of stainless steel and are embedded onto a grade 5 titanium case with a slight grainy finish. the bezel shows off subtle finishing differences on two levels: the upper part is polished, contrasting elegantly with the lower part, using circular brushing. the lugs are polished on top and horizontally brushed on the sides. it\u2019s not a sports watch, but a better water resistance than 30 meters would have been appreciated (although, this depends on whether baltic means actual 30 meters, or just hand washing). \n\nthe material, finishes and colors get even wilder when you see the dial. all of the four possible color options have a deep guilloch\u00e9 pattern radiating from the center of the dial. the pattern is interrupted with a brushed sector where baltic placed the applied and polished indexes which have an almost pyramid-like shape. at 6 o\u2019clock was the seconds sub-counter with a grained dial. even the hands are absolutely spectacular - dauphine shaped, deeply brushed on top and with highly polished chamfers. i really do suggest you click through to the baltic website to see more detailed photos. there\u2019s so much to see. \n\nthe prismic collection comes in four colors - purple, green, salmon or grey blue. all of them have a high shine on the dial and look completely unique and unlike anything else on the market. it\u2019s great to see how well baltic is working with color. \n\nto keep things thin, baltic is using the hand-wound peseux 7001 caliber, which is just 2,5mm thick and developed by the swiss eta manufacture. it beats at 21,600 vph and has a decent power reserve of 42 hours. out back is a sapphire caseback, which is a great thing, as the movement is just as beautiful as the dials. decorations include diamond polished bevels, c\u00f4tes de gen\u00e8ve on the bridges, soleillage of ratchet and crown wheel, blued screws and beading of the main plate balance wheel. the watch comes on either an italian calf leather strap or a beautiful new brushed, braided mesh stainless steel bracelet. it look supple and very retro, with a sliding clasp and a quick release system. \n\nthe new baltic prismic collection is available for pre-order now and the pre-order window closes in 10 days, on february 25th at 4pm central european time. the first batch will be delivered in july 2024 and the second in october. pricing is set at \u20ac990 for the leather strap and \u20ac1,050 on the metal bracelet, both without vat. it\u2019s an incredibly busy watch, but in the best possible way. i think baltic has another hit on their hands, can\u2019t wait to see what else they have in store. see more [**on the baltic

\n\n**2/**\n\n[**omega updates the 41mm constellation collection with brand new meteorite dials**](https://www.omegawatches.com/watches/constellation/constellation/catalog?pin=10727&utm_source=itsabouttime.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=this-is-the-new-baltic-prismic-and-it-s-absolutely-spectacular-omega-updates-the-41mm-constellation-with-meteorite-dials-vulcain-releases-the-grand-prix-new-from-minase-and-revolution-x-minase)\n\nin a lineup of perfectly acceptable watches, the constellation stands out as the one controversial watch from omega. despite being their second oldest collection, proceeded only by the seamaster, the constellation, with the claws on the bezel, integrated bezel and very 80s look, is an acquired taste. some will tell you they adore it, others will say it\u2019s the ugliest thing ever made. now omeg has modernized the constellation in their largest size, the 41mm, with 5 new colors with meteorite dials. \n\ndespite omega also making a mid-sized constellation in 39mm, the new meteorite dials come only in the larger 41mm, three in steel and two in gold. aside from the new dials, it\u2019s still the same constellation, meaning it measures 41mm wide, 13.5mm thick and with a pleasant 44mm lug-to-lug. the recognisable claws on the bezel are polished and present on both the gold and ceramic bezels and the case has rounded half-moon facets. \n\nthere are a lot of firsts in this collection. it\u2019s the first time the constellation is available in 18k moonshine gold and the first time the 41mm models are available with a steel bracelet. depending on the colour, the bezel is either ceramic (black ceramic for the silver version, green ceramic on the pvd green version) or metal, with the roman numerals in positive relief obtained by laser ablating (for the blue, moonshine and sedna versions). the blue version has a bezel in grade 5 titanium. \n\nspeaking of the color, it comes from a pvd coat that is applied to the muonionalusta meteorite found in sweden. it\u2019s a mostly iron-based meteorite with a significant proportion of nickel that has a classic widmanst\u00e4tten pattern. the available coatings are sedna pvd gold, moonshine pvd gold, green pvd or blue pvd. the silver model isn\u2019t pvd coated and has been finished with a galvanic treatment. depending on the model, the applied markers and the constellation star are either black pvd, 18k white gold, 18k moonshine gold or 18k sedna gold. \n\ninside the steel models is the calibre 8900 while the calibre 8901 is in the gold models, with the difference between the two being a solid gold rotor and balance bridge on the latter. the movements have a co-axial escapement, a silicon balance spring, double-barrels in series and a master chronometer certification. it beats at 25,200vph and has a 60 hour power reserve. \n\nthe new omega constellation 41mm meteorite dial watches are available now in a range of prices. the blue retails for \u20ac10,300, the silver and green for \u20ac10,700 and the gold \u20ac46,600. see more [**on the omega

        "text": "i tend to collect/prefer space related watches and this is a recent, somewhat affordable acquisition. the glycine airman was worn by pete conrad during the gemini program (missions 5 and 11). this particular example is likely from somewhere between 1963 and 1965, with the screw down case, a. schild 1700/1 movement, 24 hour gmt dial and a unique hacking mechanism that stops the second hand at 24. the outer gmt bezel is secured with a screwdown plate and otherwise rotates freely. it's wearing the reproduction jb champion komfit mesh bracelet made by forstner which i think works a lot better on this watch and the accutron astronaut than the speedmaster due to the bezel diameter. i haven't put it on a timegrapher but based on observation it's running at about +1.5 seconds a day which is frighteningly accurate for a 55+ year old watch that was last serviced over 4 years ago. it's a smaller watch at 36mm but the 20mm lugs are quite long so it wears a lot bigger than you would think.",

(sidenote: having an exhibition caseback can be installed on the hesalite model if someone really wanted it). sapphire doesn\u2019t scratch nearly as easily. so many people prefer that, especially on watches they wear often/daily.",

        "text": "i don't know about \"slept on\", they're just not as popular for two reasons:\n\n1) the most popular chronographs are the ones in the 3-6-9 subdial configurations- daytona, el primero, universal geneve compax, apro chronos, etc.  the 6-9-12 layout is just not as popular\n\n2) cause moon landing\n\nalso servicing a moonwatch (at least the pre-coaxials as i have no experience with coaxial ownership) is generally cheaper (at least at the certified indies that i've been to) than the automatics because as manuals, they're less complicated; you don't have to deal with all the additional (and constantly moving parts) in the autoworks. the one that was the most complicated were the \"reduced\" with the dubois depraz piggyback chrono module. those were easier to service by completely replacing the the chronograph module.\n\nsecondary pricing is mostly subject to collectable a watch is.  vintage moonwatches with the 321 movement are pretty pricey, but vintage seamasters with the same movement are not nearly as expensive because waaaay fewer people collect them.  nothing inherent about the automatic movements justifies a lower price, except that the aforementioned piggyback chrono movement tends to depress prices of the reduced pieces because everyone factors in an expensive service on those.",

        "text": "sorry in advance for the long read. \n\nmy dad has a carrera and autavia from like 05 and used to daily a formula 1 quartz from like 06-07 up to about 2023, never had any problems with mine until i broke the f1 trying to repair a broken part on my own. i\u2019m not a very good indicator since i take really good care of pretty much everything i have even if it\u2019s a piece of shit seiko/swatch/tissot or a god tier casio.  \n\nfrom my experience the older tags feel just as solid as any mid tier swiss (longines/sinn/tudor/breitling). zenith, rolex and omega 100% feel one tier above on pretty much the entire model lineup but it\u2019s not a night and day difference as people like to act it is, and the extra cash is not worth it at current market prices unless you can get a deal from japan. my old rolex submariner felt like a freaking tank (subs are seriously tough way more than the other rolexes bar the explorer), the speedy is a bit more fragile due to the chronograph mechanism so i\u2019m much more careful. i don\u2019t care if i get downvoted to hell, the seamaster is just not as tough as a pre 202x\u2019 submariners (before they went gold) no one can convince me otherwise, i had a planet ocean which i never loved.\n\ntwo of my friends are jewelers so i\u2019m constantly exposed to a fair share ap\u2019s, vc\u2019s, rarer rolex\u2019s, the odd hublot/rm\u2019s here and there so i tend to base of how they feel/look instead of what online trolls think. stuff like vc and ap blows rolex and omega out of the water it\u2019s not even close but i would never buy any and wearing them for a day or two didn\u2019t feel any more special than my speedy or seamaster its all placebo and snobbery. \n\ni can\u2019t speak to the current state of tag so yeah it\u2019s a bigger gamble than ever before but lvmh have been trying very hard to revamp the brand especially since that recently leaked f1 deal which means they are going to heavily invest, i\u2019d go for it if you get a warranty and heavy store discounts which are super easy to get. \n\ntldr; passing on to the little ones: omega without a shred of a doubt i can\u2019t stress this enough. if it\u2019s just for personal use and banging it up go for the tag if you get a good price and warranty, omega will retain its value better so just cement that into your decision. in my opinion: wait a few months for the market to inevitably collapse and buy something even better than these two for about the same prices. cars and watch markets are currently a joke",

        "text": "hot take:\n\nluxury watch brands should all have at least one \u201caspirational\u201d piece that requires a buying-history or special circumstance to acquire.  from porsche, to ferrari, to rolex, to louis, to omega\u2026 the exclusivity factor is important for the brand to retain its luxurious image in the minds of consumers.  an easily acquired speedmaster costs $7,000. the median household income in the united states is $80,000.  after taxes, that puts the cost of one of omega\u2019s flagship models at over 10% of the median household\u2019s net income.  that\u2019s clearly a luxury item that omega sells a boatload of every year- they are able to sell a device that simply tells the time and \u201ctimes stuff\u201d by maintaining a brand image that exudes luxury.  to do that, you need to have some stuff that\u2019s \u201chard to get\u201d.  \n\na terrible side-effect of this, in my opinion, is that a \u201ctrue enthusiast\u201d may be pushed out of the market (or the hobby entirely) as a result of not being able to spend as much money as another enthusiast.  another side-effect, of course, is the entrance of flippers and scalpers that take advantage of the situation and find a way to acquire the \u201chard to get\u201d pieces simply to re-sell.\n\ni\u2019m on both sides of this.  i\u2019ve got a strong omega ob buy-history.  very likely to be allocated a snoopy in the next few months (i\u2019ve been offered one already, and turned it down for some personal reasons\u2026asked them to call me again in q1 or q2 of 2025, and i have a high conviction that they will\u2026they told me they would).   on the other side of the coin, i love rolex, too.  i desperately want a pepsi on oyster, but i can\u2019t get an ad to even look me in the eye when i ask for one.  i have no meaningful buying history to compete with the rest of the population that wants a pepsi.  is that frustrating?  yes.  do i believe the ad when they tell me that rolex can\u2019t figure out how to mass produce the bezel?  my guess is that they\u2019ve figured out how to produce enough to keep the pepsi \u201chard-to-get\u201d and could hire more people/build more machinery to pump them out if they wanted to\u2026..but they don\u2019t want to.  simple as that. \n\nto answer your question directly- the response you got means that they aren\u2019t going to sell you the watch unless you buy at least one (probably 2 or 3) pieces from them at retail.  you could do that, and get yourself a snoopy.  if there\u2019s another omega piece that you really want, you might simply ask \u201chey, if i buy xyz, could i get a snoopy on the same day?\u201d.  worst they can say is \u2018no\u2019.  \n\nyou could also buy the pieces they recommend buying, sell them (at a loss, almost guaranteed), and then buy your snoopy\u2026. but, obviously, by the time you do that, you could\u2019ve just gone \u201cgrey\u201d and probably gotten into the watch for a cheaper price.\n\nthe choice before you is an annoying reality.  your other option, of course, is to flip them the bird and move on\u2026.if they produce the 50th snoopy until a 60th edition is released, the price is very likely to settle out at or below retail on the secondary market.  my ob hasn\u2019t heard a peep about a 55th edition, so that\u2019s entirely possible if they don\u2019t discontinue it this year.",

        "text": "some thoughts here as someone who has owned both generations of the heritage and an smp-\n\nthe first gen heritage is going to be the least expensive of these (most likely). it has an amazing dial- the sandblast really pops in sunlight. in lower light conditions, the hands and silver/white numerals are pleasantly highly reflective. but... it comes with some downsides. the first is that the watch is 14.95mm tall. height isn't an issue to everyone, but the height here is *mostly* in the case. it will catch on shirt cuffs (especially on a nato). it's a top-heavy watch and it wears like one. the second issue is the bracelet- which has male centerlinks that extend the on-wrist lug-to-lug to 54mm from 48mm. it wears big both in height and wrist spread, worth considering if you have a wrist under 7.25\" in diameter. also, those centerlinks are polished, and they show scratches.\n\nmoving on to the second generation heritage- this watch fixes all the dimension issues the first gen has. the height is 13.8mm *but* the actual caseback-to-bezel height is just under 12mm- the crystal is much more domed than the prior gen and the case essentially shares height with the smp. the male centerlink is female, so it wears at a true 48mm lug-to-lug. the outerlinks are polished, which are both historically accurate *and* makes the watch age more gracefully than its predecessor. it wears amazingly well, perfect as far as i am concerned and i know people with wrists down in the low 6s that it looks great on.  the sandwich dial is beautiful and has amazing shadowplay, but loses some of the wonder of the first gen dial without the more noticeable sandblast. i genuinely wish they'd kept this feature! also- the bezel moved from ceramic back to aluminum. it's durable aluminum, so no concern there, but has a completely different look than the ceramic bezel does. still, my pick between the first and second gen is easily the second.\n\nlastly, the smp- 42mm bezel diameter and a lug-to-lug of 49.7mm (for this model, slightly reduced vs the date smp) makes it a bit larger than the 41mm x 48mm heritage, and it wears larger. height is essentially identical at 13.8mm and it wears similarly but definitely feels chunkier. the lyred \"professional\" style lugs and scalloped bezel give it a vastly different appearance; neither is better than the other, both are great.  and- while i miss the ceramic bezel on the heritage, the aluminum bezel on the nd smp really helps the dial/bezel ratios look better than they do on the all-ceramic, date smp. and the aluminum dial is just absolutely fantastic. the combination of visual cues really makes it wear well and it plays with light in pleasing ways the all ceramic model can't touch.\n\ni love boats. i love history. i love brunches too, and although i'm more often in outdoors gear than i am a suit, i like watches that can dress up and down. if i was picking two watches off this list it would be #2 and #3, but if i could only pick one it is easily the heritage. it's going to wear better overall, pair with everything, and look great with your boat gear, at brunch with a mimosa, or with a suit. the original seamaster 300 from 1957 aimed to do all of these things and the current heritage does it just as well.",

(if you do have an early reference 396.1042, you definitely don't want to send it to omega.)\n\nif omega services the watch, they'll actually do quite a lot. some of the following is optional if you ask them not to, but by default:\n\n- update the movement to the latest revision. omega does not service quartz movements, they simply replace them. and the quartz movements used in these watches underwent several revisions. so it's nice to get the latest and greatest.\n- replace the hands with new ones.\n- if warranted or requested, replace the bezel and/or dial at an additional cost.\n- replace the crown, hev, and associated gaskets.\n- replace the caseback gasket.\n- replace pins and collars in the bracelet.\n- polish case and bracelet if desired.\n- perform water resistance check to verify original rating.\n- provide a 2-year warranty.\n\nfor all intents and purposes, it's like getting a brand new watch. last i checked, local watchmakers in atlanta were quoting around $400 for a quartz service that didn't include nearly this much work. since omega only charges $500, i think the omega service is a relative bargain.\n\nas for authentication, there really isn't much to do for these watches. the serial number should be engraved on the lug at 7:30, though, if the watch was originally sold grey market, that might have been polished out. originality of the movement isn't an issue since, as noted above, those are regularly replaced in their entirety during service. the only potential concern would be if the omega cal. 1538 was swapped for a generic eta 255.461. those are actually the same movement, but omega's has a bit more decoration. you can verify that yourself by opening the case back and looking for an \"omega\" engraving on the coil bridge.",

        "text": "on 8900 movement, dual barrel give more power reserve as well as more steady power as the watch winds down(better accuracy at the end of power), jump hour feature is more unique, and the finish is a bit better(example, behind the balance spring and center of the rotor). the better movement and increased depth rating would be the main argument for the planet ocean being higher quality. though harder to argue for that with the smaller planet ocean that uses the 8800 movement...\n\nother than the quality argument, i'd also point to the longer design heritage of the planet ocean. it is based on the original dive seamaster as well as the military seamaster. it feels more like a proper omega dna dive watch, whereas seamaster 300m traces back to the 90s. both part of omega dna at this point, but po has more heritage in my opinion.",

(this can be a hard question.)\n- what other watches do you own?\n\ni would say if you strongly prefer the speedy -or- you expect this to be your only watch in this price range (or only one for a while), wait to get the speedy. \n\ni love the smps but i think the speedy is much more versatile. the nttd and the newer titanium seamasters are awesome but don\u2019t help you here since pricier than a speedy!\n\na big pro of the smp though is it can be a gada daily watch, notably very comfortable for beach/pool/swimming. most people won\u2019t do that with their speedy (even though you can if it\u2019s new). the smp doesn\u2019t make for a great dress watch though (base models on rubber).\n\nspeedy can serve as a dress watch on leather or bracelet.",
