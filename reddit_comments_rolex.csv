SuspiciousCanary8245,gmt,"hey op. i think you are way off here, the gold yacht master one has never been a popular model. it has almost always traded below retail. it is easily the least popular, yellow gold sport model. it’s probably the least popular gold rolex. the chances of daytonas and gmt’s trading for melt is remote, if not impossible.

lots of older, undesirable, gold watches, trade for melt. why would this happen to the most popular rolexes?",2025-04-23 05:51:37

Euphoric_Ad_6091,gmt,agreed i hate that they make you feel lucky to spend 1000s on a watch but i can’t bring myself to pay over the odds - in the uk a gmt grnr is around £15k grey! i’m quite young and will likely purchase an engagement ring at some point so hopefully that pushes me up the list,2025-04-21 13:56:56

ZachSS69,gmt,"my friend, i’m not famillar with the ads in india but based on your 2 examples that it’s the same experience everywhere. to get a gmt as a first purchase is rare, unless you are the luckiest guy in the world or know someone in the ad management. that said, a 2-3 year wait is normal and it helps if you buy something else a dj/op/ak or some jewelry if it’s a jewelry store. best of luck",2025-04-18 19:56:42
RohitAhuja3,gmt,"maybe you’re right. they’ve just put me on the list.

in the meantime, i’ll have to build a purchase history to even get close to the one i really want. even then, a pepsi might still be out of reach.

Rollienomics,gmt,"so here’s the order i think you will get the fastest from the ad. i’ve posted multiple times that i don’t understand the disconnect of the full rg gmt, it’s not loved a lot, but it’s absolutely amazing in person.

these are my tiers, day date and daytona are close to the same timeframe simply because there’s more options of these models (17 dd and 7 daytona)

i do think the sub is probably your longest wait  because those are the only two options for pm. 

but i suspect the jubilee is popular so may be higher demand.

4.	⁠full rg rootbeer

BeardedGunDude,gmt,"brinkers was my ad. tbh, i was never really happy with how they treated me because they definitely played the favoritism game on who got watches based on who had spent the most with them in the past. a friend of mine put in for the same gmt a couple weeks before me and got his watch in around 7 months versus me never getting it after 3 years just because he had a bigger spend history. i can totally understand that he is a priority over me in a 1:1 scenario, but to never give me a chance to purchase in all that time is wild. they also never seemed to care about selling me anything other than entry level watches like oris or nomos (which i had purchased from them in the past). it made it uncomfortable to go in there, whereas i’ve been in vacheron’s ad in zurich and they treated me like a king even after i told them i couldn’t afford what i was looking at by taking it out, and telling me “it never hurts to try it on, you may want it one day”, and making the experience so great to the point that one day i will buy one of their watches. similar experiences with blancpain, ap, omega, jlc, and iwc ad’s.",2025-04-16 00:09:31

Lazy_Scholar_3362,gmt,"going to be an uphill battle if you’re insisting on going through a rolex authorized dealer (ad) and not paying over retail. it’s not impossible, but fairly difficult.

i purchased a gmt pepsi from an ad a few years ago and it took about 8 months with some effort on my part as far as “building a relationship”. i also had a unique job so that helped a lot. i wouldn’t recommend it as a strategy, the way i wouldn’t recommend trying to talk your way into an upgrade for first class.

give it a shot and you might get lucky. i’d recommend going to a smaller family owned ad and having a compelling story for why you want to buy a gmt. work, marking an occasion, celebrate a milestone. etc. be prepared to wait a long and visit them a few times to make sure they know you're serious and remember you.

if you’re not naturally charming and charismatic with a great personality, it might a fruitless endeavor. if you have interesting things to talk about (besides rolex) you could get lucky and have a gmt offered to you as your first rolex.

good luck.",2025-04-14 14:13:05
xgalaxy00,gmt,"if you’re going to play the ad game and wait for a gmt at mspr, i recommend:

1. be flexible, tell them you are interested in any gmt, or any stainless steel gmt, or any stainless steel or two-tone gmt, etc. the more models you are open to purchasing the better your chances. 

2. put your name down on the list at multiple ads. they don’t talk to each other. if you get the watch, call the other ads and remove your name from the list. 

3. make a decision now on how long you are willing to wait before spending $xx extra dollars on a gray market gmt. you may think that right now there is “no way” you would pay over msrp, but after over 1-3 years of waiting you may decide it’s worth it after all. especially once you start going down the slippery slope of buying your wife jewelry to get some interest from the ad. even if you go gray and end up getting the watch later at msrp, you can always sell that watch and recoup some of your money.

1) buy/request a precious metal version of the watch (two tone or solid gold)

2) buy high mark up jewellery and/or wedding rings with diamonds from the same ad and hope that moves you up or negotiate it openly

3) buy it on grey market

4) wait

if your small ad gets 1-5 steel submariners a month and there's 100-200 people on list....tell me how long you think that wait is. **also, be mindful and know this as law: there is no wait list, there is no queue, there is only allocation.** how ads allocate is up to them, but you can put your name for a daytona and never get the call.

with zero purchase history from the ad, you're basically a nobody and perpetually the last person they would ever call. so imagine you wait 3 years and never spend a dime there. yet 50 people in that same time span drop in and buy rings, diamonds, bracelets, necklaces, other watches, etc and request a submariner. in that scenario, which is a very likely one, you never get your steel submariner.

sorry to burst your bubble. this is why most people go grey or buy a precious metal variant.",2025-04-14 20:09:44
Bizcut1,gmt,"if you live in or near a major city and only have access to a select number of ad's, and are not a big hitter, be prepared for a three to five year wait. my ad here in phoenix, says they are about 300 deep on the list for a batman for pepsi and over 400 deep for a sub.  they receive about eight gmt's per quarter and even fewer subs.(excluding special pm orders).  select another brand, buy vintage or neo-vintage, or accept a reality as the rest of us have. you can bitch, whine, and moan about everything rolex..from scarcity to the ad experience...and, believe me, everyone here does ad nausem, won't make any difference..",2025-04-14 22:02:03
ZachSS69,gmt,"does not matter what market you are in, a gmt as a first purchase is almost impossible better odds of winning the lottery. you might have better luck with a tt gmt models, grnr,chnr, still not easy, a full ss model to start never. you must make a purchase or two at the ad, a date just or air king or both, then ask for the ss gmt.  unfortunately that is the way it goes pretty much, everywhere. this is the reason why people pay the extra $5k to the grey market dealer.",2025-04-14 22:36:32
Pincer,gmt,"i wouldn’t be over fixated on the challenge. the luxury market is in a downward trend with everything going on in the markets. sure it’s a hard watch to get and the lower price point of ss models means competition dies down the slowest there but at some point you can just get lucky. so i hope you get lucky 🍀 

personally, i would look up all the rolex ads within the travel time you’re okay with and i’d make a few days of going to each and saying hi.  i would also stop by some grey market shops and maybe in this market the price difference isn’t big (note where i am tt is currently cheaper grey than new). 

also, there’s so many people that stupidly buy expensive watches they can’t afford to wear that many (most?) grey watches look brand new. 

now if you can afford it tt or pm models will be way easier to get walk in. i got my sea dweller tt on a walk in two weeks ago with no spend history and the shop had 8-10 watches available to walk-ins (no pepsi gmt though..)",2025-04-15 03:28:55

toifelhund,gmt,"would you consider an older model gmt like a 16710? personally, i think the new gmts are a step backwards. the older models are better proportioned and less chunky than the latest models and i think the aluminum bezels have more character and brighter colors. i tried the ceramic pepsi and the colors just look kind of purple and washed out. i think a lot of people want that color either because it was the original issued to pan am pilots with their airline’s colors or because of the rumors it’ll be discontinued. ironically, many original pilots disliked that color saying it looked too much like a fisher price watch. personally i prefer plain black on a jubilee or a red and black coke bezel on the oyster (the coke bezel isn’t available on new models). one huge advantage of the aluminum bezels, in my opinion, is that you can easily swap them out which effectively gives you several watches in one. you can’t do this with the ceramic bezels and many watchmakers won’t touch them for fear of cracking them because they are so brittle. on top of this, it is easier to get both the oyster and jubilee bracelets on the older gmt’s. they have a classic rugged look (think magnum pi or iceman). the new gmt oyster bracelets have polished bracelets which in my opinion are overly flashy and effete little pieces of so called man jewelry (not to mention they’ll get scratched all to hell anyway). finally, i think the biggest benefit is that you don’t have to play games with ad’s. nobody should have to suck up or buy unwanted items just to get a stupid watch. anything other than first come first serve is sleazy third world type of behavior. personally, i had to go through all of that i wouldn’t be able to enjoy the watch if i did that because it would be an everyday reminder that i was a sucker. i am really happy with my 16710 and would choose it over a later model any day.",2025-04-16 05:27:45

leklitz,gmt,"the 2. above spiked my interested (call the other ad to have you name removed), so if i may, i would bluntly ask this sub:

if:
- op got the gmt with ad1,
- didn't tell ad2,
- got a second call from ad2,
- bought a second gmt
- to resell it to make a quick few thousands on the side?

(all highly hypothetical of course, given his apparent chances to even receive one call)

a. are the names of op (at ad1) communicated to rolex so they have a say when ad2 has it available again?
b. if ad2 sells it to op, is it registered that op bought similar models twice within a short period?
c. if op sells one of them quickly after its purchase, does op get blacklisted? selling with ""box + papers"" is a big plus, but there's obviously your name on the invoice...
d. what would be the stand of this sub in regards to such a behaviour (fuelling the grey market, benefiting of a lucky allocation to the detriment of somebody ""waiting for the call"" etc).

porkrind,gmt,"there was a period of time during covid and a year or so after where \_nothing\_ was available for a walk in. zero for sale watches in the displays. there are photos from that time period of some ads with completely empty cases, nothing even to try on.

the market has softened considerably since then (some would say it's crashing) such that several models are generally available now, especially if you aren't picky about dial color or just happen to be lucky. ladies' watches, very expensive precious metal watches, and some of the larger production 'entry level' mens' watches are starting to be stocked again as demand cools off. there is some hope among fans that this trend will continue to the gmts and daytonas  as rolex has some new factories coming online. of course recent political activity means who knows what right now. 

pre- about 2018, most everything was available from a decently sized ad. maybe not the daytona, but that was still actually order-able, back when it really was placing an order and not just getting on a list.

worth noting that most ads do not actually have a list in the way that normal people think of it. it's not a numbered series of requests in the order they came in. it's more like ""here's a big pool of names that want this watch."" when a pepsi gmt comes in (and it may really be fewer than five a year) the look at that pool of names and try to balance a number of intangibles. who's spent a lot with the ad on other stuff? who's a big-wig that probably will spend a lot if we favor them? who gets a lot of press? who's got a major life milestone coming that would generate a lot of social media likes? who does the staff at the ad personally \_like\_?

sporturawus,gmt,"the advice to give them is simple:

a.  never never never let any random local watchmaker, or even rolex ad themselves, touch the first two.  explain to them that the slightest scratch to a dial or the swap of the hands will cost them $5000+ in value.

b.  email photos of the actual watches to all the sellers on our trusted sellers list and 1) explain that they are selling these as a bundle and 2) to accept the best offer.

trying to sell these privately is a hornets next wrought with rip offs, scams, armed robbery, bait and switch, credit card fraud.  c24 is a mess.  private listings in forums is dangerous.  they cannot attempt this.

dealers will try to get the steel sub and maybe the two-tone gmt.  the dj's and the date are meh.  so to get the most value, they should leverage the first two against the last three and get all 5 sold in a bundle.

tldr:  sell all 5 as a package deal to the trusted seller who pays the most.

hopefully they can get you the op quickly and that'll get things moving for you. from the rest of your collection, it sounds like you can probably afford to go grey and i think that'll be the only way you can get all of the ss gmts in your desired timeframe (even with a good ad purchase history).",2025-04-09 11:48:24

Best-Extent646,gmt,"hey mate, i am in aus too and would like to share some experiences i've had personally.

i started my rolex journey about 2 years ago. interested in the gmt pepsi and batgirl, had a friend who has them and instantly feel in love with it.

so i rocked up to a well know ad and put my name down for one, at this point i’ve been told the “wait list” is long (over 100 people). no worries, i heard stories of these ad games, i am not new to buying luxury goods. i thought, yeah i’ll put my name down for an entry level watch for the misses as well. settled on a few configuration of a 31mm dj in various different dial options. showed up every other month and several emails/sms every other week. still waiting on the dj to this day.



couple of weeks ago, i bought the batgirl from a grey dealer, all brand new. although it’s higher than msrp or on the higher end of the grey dealer market price. ultimately, i am buying the dealer not so much the watch. i am enjoying it now and hasn’t been off my wrist, if i am ever lucky enough to get this watch from my ad at msrp then i’ll just sell one.



i’ve got better things to do than to pretend i am best bros with the sa.



another story is, i got a friend who’s already purchased a few pieces from an ad. a couple of subs and a tt daytona, he started before the pandemic so i guess it was a bit easier back then. hes been on the list for a gmt for over a year and still hasn’t been offered anything outside of pm or tt variants of models.



he has a good relationship with their sa and were told in private that clients with over 300k spend history is yet to receive a batgirl/pepsi. the best they got allocated was the sprite or root beer.



not meaning to discourage you but you might be waiting a while not impossible but your odds are as good as winning the lottery.",2025-04-09 23:03:12
LostSpecters,gmt,"my advice, and this is coming from a guy who has a pepsi i got in less than a year with no purchase history.
number one, find an ad that is just a rolex store. if all that store does is move rolex watches you’re more likely to get a rolex. no jewelry and other brand bullshit or building a purchase history. 

number two, my sa told me this, pick a specific watch you want. the guys who come in saying they want all the gmts or whatever one they can get fastest always get put on the bottom of the list and rarely get the call because to someone else that specific color and bracelet is their dream watch, so be specific and have a good reason why you love that specific watch. 

number three, don’t be an ad whore, my sa told me that first day we met. he said they can punch your info into there system and see how many ad lists you are on and how many watches you are waiting for. if you’re shopping around or requesting the same watch from multiple locations you look like a flipper and you’ll never get the call

number four and honestly the most important one is find a sa that you click with and can have a genuine human connection with. build a friendship and then they will prioritize you way more then spend history or how long you waited. 

how fully this helps",2025-04-10 01:50:09

wanting to buy 5 watches whose cumulative value is $50k over msrp on the secondary market the moment you leave the shop doesn't make you a desirable customer.  it's the exact opposite.  it makes you a pain in the ass who is going to keep pestering them every 60 days with your boring origin story when they know they are never selling you a watch.",2025-04-09 13:19:59

SuspectFamous9097,gmt,"yeah maybe, in gray territory... and then we hit a minor recession and it goes down again - maybe even below retail (like what happens with virtually all used goods on on planet earth).

TheSauce775,gmt,"ya they want you to get ur spend history up with them, and pm and tt models that dont sell at a premium like the ss models do, they try to sell off.. but for sure its an amazing watch to be offered still, probly only like 5-10% less on the gray market honestly so it might be better to just get the ad purchase and spend the $ for retail rolex at that ad, cus then your next call might just be a ss model gmt ii 🤷🏻‍♂️",2025-04-03 01:46:40
Mobile_Ad_5561,gmt,i doubt you will get a ss gmt with no buying history. i don’t think they will ever get you one unless things change dramatically in the world economy. they are offering you a cool watch but it’s not what you want and i’m guessing it’s about $7000k more expensive. you will lose money if you buy this then sell it because it’s not popular. but it is nice.,2025-04-03 05:52:09

back in 2022 the ceo announces the new factory to much fanfare, says he understands the frustration of supply not keeping up with demand, how they want to be more accessible, etc.

now in 2025 instead of thinning the bloated line down (they offer 733 datejusts) or dropping entire lines (like yacht master) to open up more production *or* just leaving things alone and letting the new factory open, they go out and create *another* line.  and with a new movement.  and with a new bracelet.  and one that will be very popular as it's *another* datejust clone.

and then there is the issue of other watches that can now be created.  land dweller is essentially an ultrathin datejust at a 50% premium.  rolex could do the same to, say, the day date or the daytona, thinner, lighter, integrated flat jubilee bracelet, charge a premium.

2. settino bracelet on the 1908 - love this gold / black dial w the settino bracelet.    i can't wait to see some good reps of this watch, but doubt we ever will get any.
3. lavender and the lime green op dials.    cant wait to get the battle between vsf and clean started on who will have the best lime green and best lavender dial.
4. red omber dial - i see more and more push towards red and i think after green and blue the brands are slowly pushing red as the next fashion statement 

overall more excitement from rolex than years past.     the above three really caught my attention.   what i wish to see from them further:  
a second more dressy gmt based on a variation of the new movement  
a second chrono watch since daytona is so hard to get

a little heads up: since the 1980s, rolex's mo has been to turn the ""one-and-done"" customer into a repeat buyer/collector. ask any authrized retailer worth their salt and they'll tell you the same: they're looking for repeat customers who'll eventually buy a little from every product line. it's quite harsh, i'll admit- but people who *only* buy/wear steel aren't really their target audience. 

>i feel the op is a fun and vibrant watch which used to have bright dials. these new dials are very muted.

the op was a fun/vibrant watch only at that 2020 release. prior to that, op dials were (perhaps unsurprisingly) reserved/conservative.

i'll actually agree with this. i don't know about ""ugly,"" at 50-55% the msrp i might be inclined to buy one for myself, but as of now, i don't really see the value. i suppose the new movements are designed for exhibition casebacks, but even that's done at industrial scale.

>i wish they'd have taken a risk with more stainless steel models like the sub or gmt.

they don't do that. the reason they've been so successful for over a century now is because they're more evolutionary than revolutionary. the technological changes they've done and presented in the 71xx movements show that throughout the upcoming years, they're going to update the professional models to have some really cool stuff under the hood.

your comment agrees with much of my post in a sense that it will be suitable for those looking for a new daily model and don’t want the larger available models such as a sub or gmt. 

i’m just speaking in the my post as to what i have seen online via redit and other forums over the last few days. many people have openly stated there disinterest and dislike of the new model, much like they did with the grnr and your right much like the sd many years back. 

i agree with u completely in ur statement of “what’s to hate”. i’m excited for a new model, a new movement, and forward progress from the brand.

Affectionate_Run3921,gmt,"great combo if you get the gmt on jubilee, and consider your bezel colors carefully. gmt jubilee is a very different look and feel than the all brushed sub. i rotate between these two watches frequently and would not part with either.

the green bezel sub vs blue/black gmt adds further contrast between the two, and the green just suits me vs the more common black bezel date or no date.

instead of a black sub and a blnr (both with black on the bezel), consider either (a) blnr and starbucks, or (b) black sub and pepsi/jubilee. i think black sub and a blnr is too similar at a glance if you are going for some variation.

additionally, there's a premium that actually makes sense to pay on the gray market, and that's when you consider the total time of ownership. if you only have a few years left that you can wear the watch, there's a certain premium which is justified when you consider the cost of owning the watch per day.

sporturawus,gmt,"nope.

there is a rule of collectible rolex since 1975 that goes something like this:

if the rolex wasn't drop-dead gorgeous and highly desired during its lifetime then it won't be desired and valuable during its discontinuance.

ask turn-o-graph owners.  ask milgauss owners.  ask air king owners.  ask hulk owners.  ask gmt ln owners.  ask oysterquartz owners.  there is no million dollar paul newman daytona possible anymore.  rolex doesn't make those kinds of mistakes and enthusiasts don't miss that type of opportunity.  newman pre-dated the birth of the rolex vintage market.  every watch since then, that's *50 years*, if it was blah when alive it is blah when dead.

the watch that's staring you in the face that will have a huge jump in value if it's ever discontinued?

gmt pepsi jubilee

the world is lusting after this watch for the last 7 years, the average ad only gets 1-2 pieces per year, and it's steadily trading for 150% over msrp for 5+ years straight with no end in sight.  the day pepsi gets discontinued, boom, $50,000 asking price.  because there are literally millions of people in love with it right now who can't get one.  so if it goes away forever it becomes impossible to find.",2025-03-23 19:27:01

Mental-Economy6981,gmt,"7-10 years?! that’s a sentence, not a waitlist! 

like everyone else has said, this particular ad isn’t going to sell you a new gmt pepsi. whether that’s a lack of spend history, or you just don’t fit the profile of the customer they desire - bottom line, you aren’t getting one from them at retail. 

as i see it, if you really want one, just buy it from the secondary market. the premium isn’t that much these days, and you get to wear the watch you want tomorrow.

if you really want to buy it brand new at retail, you need to up your game! in your position, i’d buy a 16710 pepsi and wear it in to an ad (a different one to the one that told you 7-10yrs). tell them you want an up to date insurance valuation and a full rolex service. that’s the beginning of your relationship with the ad, and you kickstarted your spend history. you can always sell the 16710 on again later. you love the neo-vintage, but you’ve had it a long time, you’ve been thinking about the new model. has he/she got one to try on? try a couple of other pieces on while you’re there. be a serious buyer. good luck!",2025-03-18 15:36:57

YouKnowItsJosh,submariner,"the first time i went into an ad, i did so with an “economical” mindset - i looked at the explorer 1 and dj with oyster / smooth combo. i liked them and requested to be put on the waitlist. 

i got home and found myself wondering about what i really wanted. i wanted the explorer because it is a tool watch. i wanted the dj because i love the date feature. i wanted either one because of the price.

after a week - and lots of research - i fell in love with a submariner date. it is a tool watch and has a date. and, most importantly, the glidelock had me sold. 

so, i thought to myself, “the watch i want for a bit more than i originally planned or the watch that my original budget afforded with the hopes of getting the sub date later?”

in the end, i went with the “one and done” approach. 

submariner date: everything i wanted. and, with that, the price difference was overshadowed.

justUseAnSvm,gmt,"first, i'd figure out how you want to wear the watch (everyday vs. special occasions vs. part of a rotation), then pick a watch that best fits that.

personally, i wouldn't drop close to 10k on a watch i'm not going to wear, and work remotely in tech, so an explorer 1 was just about the ideal watch i can wear at all times. if i dressed up more, or did more business in person, i love the look of the two tone everose gmt. really nice.

as for the future value, i wouldn't worry about this more than knowing that a rolex will hold value if you have to get out of it in a hurry, but they aren't investments. the stories of people who bought a rolex in 1965 coming home from the army, then sat on it for 50 years are notable because they are extremely rare.

so i'd figure out your first choice, and go talk to a ad. the stock market is absolutely tanking, so i wouldn't be surprised if getting the watch you want in the next few months will be a little bit easier with everyone seeing their numbers go down.",2025-03-10 20:29:45

no bullshit, when i was in grad school, i lived in nyc and used to scour craigslist for rolex watches. i would look for ones that were scratched up looking as a point of leverage to negotiate the price down. i’d meet the seller at rolex and have it authenticated, then pay them cash. i’d then turn around and have the watch serviced right there… and would get the watch back in, i dunno man, maybe a couple weeks at most, looking pristine and like-new. i’d then wear it for a couple months, then sling it on timezone.com and make a handsome little profit for a student. i remember buying pepsi gmts for maybe $3k and making a few hundred bucks profit on reselling them. when i think back about how much money i could have now if i would have just kept some of them, it makes me sick! 🤣 at that time, the vintage subs and gmts were all the rage. people spazzed out over patina. i guess it was when patina started to become a thing. i dunno…

i’m ok to just wait it out though for a new one. i already have an older submariner … i guess it’s getting to be close to “vintage” by now, lol. and i’ve never bought “new” from a ad. i’m ok waiting for the watch market to take a dump … it seems to go in cycles like everything else.

upon entering, they assigned me an sa who was really friendly and asked what i wanted to try on. i told him the left-handed gmt master ii in green with oyster and jubilee bracelets. they gave me some water, i tried them both on, we talked for a little while and then i said i preferred the one with jubilee bracelet. he asked me why i wanted it so i told him my reasons. after i left, the sa texted me and said he was going to work on it for me.

during the week we texted each other a little about some mutual non-watch interests.

then exactly one week later, i got a phone call asking if i wanted to come in. so i went in the next day with a friend and they had the gmt master waiting for me. they had pastries and water for me, the watch was presented in a big wooden box that i opened, then after i tried it on and paid, they sized/fitted it, then offered my friend and i any drink we wanted (they had like scotch, champagne, japanese whiskeys, etc).

follow those steps and you’ve done everything right.  however, depending on your age, the stigma of being young can hurt you.  you need to impress upon your sales clerk that you have a great job, good credit, when you come in with the card it’s not going to decline, share your linkedin, etc.",2025-02-27 13:28:37

* **blueberry gmt** -  destined to travel the world, the gmt master ii collection is celebrating its 70th anniversary this year! and what better way than to celebrate with a full platinum 'blueberry'? a deep blue or meteorite dial, jubilee or oyster bracelet, ice-blue on the two-tone bezel and gmt hand! we can see it happen! 

* **coke gmt** - or how about a watch everybody wants; the 'coke' gmt master ii! but rolex being rolex, it might come in white gold.

* **yellow gold explorer** - on top of that, we've also had the idea for a yellow gold explorer 36! worked for the sea-dweller last year, might work for this one this year!

* **perpetual 1908** - next up is a very on-trend take on the classy perpetual 1908; stone dials! malachite or lapis lazuli seem like a natural fit inside the yellow or white gold case. next to being well used in the past, we've also freed up the wonderfully intricate patterns of the malachite and lapis lazuli stones by switching to a central seconds hand!

* **sea-dweller 43 rlx titanium** - looking at the crown's portfolio, the sea-dweller 43 is one of the watches with the longest run since the last update, which was back in 2017. so why not do something fresh and exciting? it might be a bit left-field, but we could totally get behind an rlx titanium sea-dweller 43! chamfered lugs, a double-red dial because why not, and a brushed ceramic insert for that matte finished look!

* **submariner 37mm** -  something unexpected perhaps, but on par with current demands for smaller watches, is a 37mm submariner! the sub-sub, if you will! to make it stand out from its larger submariner siblings, we've given it a bit more luxurious finishings, a bit less water resistance, and have even accommodated for a change in movement by putting the date and cyclops closer to the periphery! we've imagined three versions: the classic date and no-date iterations plus a rolesor edition! which one do you like the most?

* **polar explorer** - ok, it's long been a dream of ours, and rolex knows it but hasn't budged so far; the polar explorer 36 & polar explorer 40! (make it happen, rolex, we know you're watching!)

* **root beer rolesor gmt** - for good measure, we've also thrown in a rolesor 126711chnr on a jubilee bracelet. looks rather neat, right?",2025-02-16 17:05:02

d.  **the owner:** he can swoop in at any time and take a great steel rolex for a member of his family, a friend at the club,  or his neighbor who owns the local ski shop in town.

Used_Meeting_8667,gmt,"friend of mine bought a jubilee to keep up with the jones. $3k + to get it.  i’d have trouble to put another 25%ish into the watch and i’ve got the money. you could sell the oyster, but same friend had a lot to say about the watch is cataloged with what band it came with, so he’s keeping a useless 3k bracelet around… to each his own.   

i have a black bezel gmt on oyster that’s been my daily wear watch since 2011. imo oyster looks far better. more manly and rugged. fits the watch’s personality. i’m not against jubilee, but it just seems to be a fad lately. it’s great. i’d like it for a dj with fluted bezel not a tool watch. it’s your watch, and totally up to you.  but wear it because it makes you happy and whoever thinks it should have whatever bracelet can eat a fat one.",2025-02-11 02:24:07

sporturawus,gmt,"a.  when it comes to the submariner and gmt, wrist size doesn't matter, you have to own them and they aren't available in any other size.  and 6.5"" is just fine, you don't have to worry at all.

b.  you are going to own both some day, so you need to think about which one to get first and how to configure each so that years from now there aren't redundancies you'll regret.  so here is the advice:

c.  get the no date submariner 124060 first.

d.  get the gmt pepsi or batman on jubilee second.

this way, you wind up with the best configurations of each watch *and* have substantial differences between the two-  brushed oyster vs. jubilee.  symmetrical dial vs. asymmetrical.  clean crystal vs. cyclops.  black bezel vs. colorful.

you'd *consider*? 😂. youre looking at the wrong brand. you're not going to find any great deals on any of the super hot sports steels models you posted. they're all going to have a massive gray market premium on them. and in the off chance that the planet venus frezes over and you happen to find a great deal on one, it would be gone by the time you had a chance to ""consider"". if you are serious about really owning one of the models you posted without purchase history, be ready to pay an additional $7k as a premium (with the exception of the sub date, that will be more like a $4,00-4,500 premium). if you're not willing to pay the premium i would highly suggest looking at another brand instead of wasting your time, for several years, living a fantasy that sally at your local ad will go up to bat for you the next time a gmt comes in when all you've done for her in the past is tell her stories. she's looking out for her people that pay her bills, not tell her stories about why they want a steel gmt. it's like if you were the hot girl that was the prom queen at your high school. would you go out with bubba mcchubbs, the overweight 5'5 ugly kid with bad acne and a receding hairline? unfortunately, with no purchase history of less desirable models or non-rolex brand watches, you're bubba mcchubbs. fortunately lots of other brands will treat bubba mcchubbs like royalty.",2025-02-02 06:29:20

dscaasi,gmt,"you raise a solid point about the 32xx movement's amplitude issues—it's a known concern among collectors and watchmakers. however, saying discontinued models will lose value might be too absolute. here’s why

rolex's brand power: rolex watches have a history of appreciating in value, even with known flaws. look at the explorer ii 16570 with its polar dial cracking or the sea-dweller 16600 with its helium escape valve issues. these quirks often make certain models more desirable to collectors, not less.

discontinuation drives demand: discontinued models often see a value increase simply because they become rarer. think about how the aluminum bezel gmt-masters shot up in price after the ceramic versions were introduced, even though the older models had less advanced movements.

serviceability: while the amplitude issue is a flaw, rolex service centers will likely offer movement upgrades or tweaks over time, softening the impact. also, collectors know rolex movements are built to last decades with proper servicing, flaws included.

collectors value originality: many collectors prefer original, unaltered watches, even with their flaws. a discontinued submariner or gmt with a 32xx movement could become a ""snapshot"" of that era in rolex’s history, making it more collectible.

not everyone cares about movements: the broader market of rolex buyers isn’t just hardcore collectors who care about amplitude readings. many just want a submariner because it’s a submariner. the design, heritage, and brand often matter more than the specific movement inside.

so while a new movement may shift some market dynamics, the idea that current models will lose value across the board feels unlikely.",2025-02-10 18:23:39

ScoutKBT,submariner,"thanks it is the halo piece of my collection and i adore it. particularly because it would have been made on or around my birth year. it’s the most perfect dial i’ve seen. i don’t know the history unfortunately but it appears to have spent much of the last 50 years in a drawer. the tritium is entering its 5th half-life so its radioactivity is almost completely depleted and doesn’t glow at all at this point which is what you would expect at this age. glow would indicate relume at some point so no glow is good. the tritium on the hands match the dial perfectly so my guess is that both are original. lots of drsds have had clasps and bracelets replaced in the 90’s or early 2000’s but this one has all original matching and correct part numbers for end links, bracelet, and clasp. the bracelet has little to no stretch and is in incredible condition. it’s impossible to know if the superdome crystal has been replaced but it’s in great condition and slightly cloudy indicating some age but no visible deep scratches. the 1665 superdome crystal is acrylic and very very thick to achieve what was at the time (and still is to some extent) an incredible depth rating. this is the first rolex with a gas escape value. submariner crystals were popping off due to internal gas pressure building during the decompression process. the dsrd was the solution. the case back is also correct. the crown happens to line up almost perfectly upright, a nice bonus. the bezel insert and dial fade are identical giving me hope that the bezel insert is original as well. i’m not a bezel expert like some collectors but this one has the correct fat font and serif features on the 5 that is sometimes lost upon later replacement. there is no obvious over polishing but i would assume that at some point it was polished lightly but you can clearly see the chamfered edges of the case so anything that may have been done was minimal. immediately before i acquired it, it was serviced by rolex so i know it’s 100% authentic. the only thing it lacks is that deep pumpkin patina which according to the tritium nerds out there requires years of exposure to sunlight. this watch probably was not worn enough to get that for better or worse. :)",2025-03-31 14:05:04
sporturawus,submariner,i would save a little more money and get the new one. in 1992 all submariners came on hollow endlink bracelets which really makes them imbalanced on the wrist and feeling cheap.  this isn’t an either/or situation. you either love vintage watches or you don’t. they aren’t interchangeable. they are vastly different.,2025-03-29 22:30:08

Sasquatchii,submariner,"i've had the current-gen black sub-date and bluesy, as well as the 39.5mm blue seaq on a bracelet. each has its pros and cons. you've already had a submariner, so, i'll just give you my perspective on the seaq from a sub owner.

first, have you tried on the seaq? if you haven't, i'd really encourage you to do so. (i can't tell if the second pic is your wrist or stock images) it wears significantly thinner and more comfortably than the 41mm submariner. one cool thing about the seaq i don't see mentioned anywhere is that even though it's a smaller watch than the sub, the dial itself is larger (or equally large), with a doomed sapphire crystal and a thinner bezel, which means that visually, when reading the time or just admiring the dial/applied indices, it's easier imo.

speaking of which, the dial and indices are amazing. just perfect. it's a little funky chicken with the 2/4/6/8/10/12, but that's what's fun about it. as i mentioned, i have the blue dial which is a beautiful sunburst (one of the best there is, imo), but the green is a flat slightly textured surface, so will have a different effect.

the seaq has been my pick for travel over the sub. as you've probably picked up on, rolex attracts more attention. i've traveled to many places without a care in the world with my seaq. i have the pcl bracelet, which i actually think matches the elevated personality of the watch, but if i were ever in an area of concern, i'd throw it on a rubber or nylon strap. go sells their own high-quality versions of these with deployment clasps, but they're not cheap. i found a grey nylon that scratched that itch for 1/10th the price.

finishing on the seaq is really next-level. rolex is great, too, but it's like comparing an 8/10 to a 10/10.  go now allows you to order (or replace existing models) a see-through instead of the solid caseback. i actually love the solid caseback on mine and am undecided on whether to swap it for sapphire.

and of course it has the absolute best adjustment system in the business. perfect fit every time, don't even have to take the watch off your wrist to adjust. literally the best. i daily a pepsi on jubilee, and while the jubilee is more comfortable, i do hope rolex eventually offers an adjustment system like what go has. 

downsides to the seaq include lack of value retention.... if you go seaq, make sure you buy one with a hefty discount. i got a full set that was about 3 months old on the bracelet for about 6k. you can do the math on how much you'd lose should you be the sucker who pays retail.

apparently there's less magnetic resistance. again, i've had no problems during lots of travel.

and, for whatever it's worth, the ""non watch people"" in my life don't like the seaq. whenever i complain to the wife that i have too many watches and need to sell something, she always recommends i sell the seaq lol.

  
all in all, it's a beautiful watch that's perfectly proportioned and finished. it's really an ""inside baseball"" piece, and is very unlikely to attract attention - both good and bad, while traveling. i still own the seaq /bluesy, but have moved on from my black sub.

alright, now i'm off to a pool party. you know what i'm strapping on 😎",2025-03-29 13:44:53

Fondant-Puzzled,gmt,"i was in a very similar position some years ago. i opted for a ss dj41, jubilee band, fluted bezel, silver dial and sticks. i thought the submariner was too cliche, and held omega in higher regard for diving timepieces. to this day, the dj41 is a beautiful, classy watch but it gets zero wrist time. 

i’ve been fortunate to acquire several other pieces over the years; gmt master ii 116710, bluesy, and the classic submariner to name a few. 

the submariner (or sub no date as it’s also known) is without equal in my opinion. i wear it 98% of the time (for dinner dates or high profile business meetings, i’ll bring out bluesy or rock a ym) because it goes with anything and it’s an absolute work horse. the symmetry is perfect, the ceramic bezel never gets old. it is simply perfection. 

if i were to do it all over again, i would get a rolex submariner. you really can’t go wrong with any model, although i would strongly recommend sticking with a fluted bezel and jubilee bracelet if you end up with a dj. you will not regret the sub; i’ve often regretted the dj. hope this helps. cheers.",2025-03-06 04:11:20

cheers friend! i believe the 14060 is the lightest submariner. it’s between 30-60g lighter than all other steel references, and 25g lighter than the original. the easiest sub to wear for me, feel no real overall difference between it and my 16233 1998 36mm tt dj. the weight and heft centered at the watch head still gives this sub a beautiful wrist feel. also love the inconspicuousness of this watch… i can actually wear it out of the house without feeling like i’m going to get jumped in the city",2025-02-22 17:28:11

b.  the value of the watch lies in its originality.  never never never let anyone replace the dial, hands, bezel, or bracelet.  don't let anyone polish it.  leave it as-is and have someone like rolliworks do a service on it to keep it mechanically sound, waterproof, etc.

c.  look for the original box, papers, receipt, tags, etc. as those are very valuable as well.

Rolex_Art,submariner,"this is the exact bs i hate!!!!

i attempted to trade my ln submariner for a royal oak offshore (roo) and sat down with a jeweler on 47th street in nyc to negotiate.

i pointed out that the roo i wanted was listed by them on chrono for $21,000. after negotiations, we hypothetically agreed to a price of $20,000. i estimated they could sell my submariner for around $14,000—perhaps $13,000 at the lowest. they offered me $11,000 for it and planned to spend $200 on cleaning. with an open name, open date, and hangtag, it could be sold as ""like new.""

i told them, ""i'll give you cash along with the sub, but that number starts with an 8. i will gladly flip you 9 or 7 if you prefer, but that's my limit.""

i laid out the deal clearly:

* they move inventory—the roo is off their hands.
* they get approximately $8,700 in cash from me.
* they receive a watch they can sell for $13,000.
* that adds up to $21,700. subtract $200 for cleaning, and they clear a $500 profit above their original $21,000 listing price.

the jeweler countered by asking for my sub and $15,000 in cash, arguing that he buys subs for $8,500.

i responded, ""i’m sure you do, but that’s not the deal we’re making. you don’t get to make $4,000 just because i’m trading in my sub. you’re going to value it above $10,000, not below. i don’t need your watch at all.""

and with that, i walked away. that was in november—months later, the watch is still sitting on chrono. he could have moved it and made a profit, but greed got in the way. oh well. since then? i picked up an 18k grnr on december 15.

lady datejusts can range from easy to get to hard to get, primarily based on the size and the dial color. i believe mother of pearl is the hardest dial to get, but am not sure about sizes/combinations otherwise. there are so many different combinations that finding one definitely involves some luck, so it's a good idea to reach out to a few different ads.

TedriccoJones,datejust,"rolex rsc in dallas is superb.  you can also deal with them directly yourself without going through your ad which is preferrable in my opinion.

now, rolex does have some rules, in that if you send an older watch that needs something replaced, they will insist you replace it, and they won't give back your parts.  a cadre of collectors view a rolex with ""service parts"" to be somehow lesser.  i think this view is absurd expect in select circumstances.

what are those circumstances you might ask?  if, and it's a huge if, you have a sports model from the 60's and maybe into the mid-70's that's all original they can be worth serious money to the cadre of collectors i mention above, and you probably want to seek out an independent servicer who will keep everything original and not insist on a pressure test.

also, if you have an older day-date with serious bracelet stretch...rolex will insist on a new (and very expensive) bracelet, while there are independents who do repair these.

i myself own a 1968 datejust with a service pie pan dial.  the bezel is original and 14k, but the bracelet was replaced in 2005 and has 18k center links and the crown was replaced in 2018 with an 18k one so it would pass a pressure test.  all parts are rolex, installed by rolex, and i'm perfectly fine with this.  it looks beautiful and runs like new.  some would view this as a bit of a franken watch and the price would drop accordingly.  that's actually why i was able to get it for a very good price in the first place.",2025-04-13 23:35:22

FranzKempka,submariner,i have only seen this in real life only once. it was unfortunately at an airport bar when my flight was delayed and i couldn’t stop myself from laughing in their face. it was a some dork in his late 30’s wearing a submariner of all things.,2025-04-06 23:46:30
jaybw6,datejust,"im not so sure, this is steel we are taking about not a plastic or painted surface. yes, gunk can absolutely build at the ppf edges, but you also clean the watch the same way you would without ppf to get the dirt/oils off periodically.

yes i have ppf on a couple watches but not every watch i have. the firdt one i did it for was the datejust because i wanted to get a feel for it and wasn't sure if i was going to keep it. decided to keep it of course, but putting the ppf on was such a pain in the ass i left it on there.

OrdinaryFantastic631,submariner,"love my sub/date. daily wear, one-and-done. would never consider a daytona, and it would never displace my sub, even if given to me. the only watch that i would ever take off my sub is an all-platinum speedy 321. bottom line:

the daytona looks good awful to me, way too busy.",2025-04-06 04:13:48
TroyState,gmt,"i owned a two-tone with a white dial and sold it. frankly, it sucked. the screw-down pushers and the gold sub-dials made it the most unusable/legible chronograph i’ve ever owned. if you spend this money on a chronograph, get the 321 omega. 

better finishing and a single master omega watchmaker from start to finish under 20 grand. 

for 30 grand, buy a gold gmt or day date. the daytona is so overhyped. i'd much rather know the date and time in my client's time zone versus the stopwatch.  you can't even read the daytona at a glance; a 3500 used speedmaster does it with ease. a fucking timex is easier to use as a legible stopwatch.

it isn't worth the premium. at retail i'd still sell it and invest in something more interesting",2025-04-06 05:03:55
Ok_Flounder59,submariner,"i agree completely. it’s always seemed like a silly watch to me.

dereku1967,submariner,"i agree with both you and op. i went with a vintage speedmaster instead. my boss talks about getting a daytona fairly frequently. however, i get the impression he only wants it as a status symbol. i like the speedmaster for its historical significance. i guess it can also be said that the submariner is purchased for the wrong reasons also: just because everyone else has one. i think all three are iconic and instantly recognizable and copied by other makers. i guess i might consider a daytona if the prices had not been driven up into the stratosphere by the people who see watches as investments or by an offhand comment by john fucking mayer.",2025-04-06 13:21:43

sporturawus,datejust,"you’ve got two great choices and each one depends upon your lifestyle:

**datejust 31mm** \- if you work in an office, if you dress in business clothes, if you have a more dressy/upscale vibe, if you wear earrings, bracelets, and necklaces.  dj31 is the perfect ladies dress watch.  blingy jubilee bracelet, mirror-polished fluted bezel, sunburst dial, two-tone metals, it’s a watch that gets noticed.

**oyster perpetual 31mm** \- if you work from home, if you are in athleisure most of the time, if you have a more casual jeans-and-coffee-shop vibe, if you don’t wear much jewelry.  op31 is the perfect ladies sports watch.  brushed oyster bracelet, solid color dial, low bling factor.

and what you don’t know now?  you will eventually get both.  start with the op31, get the dj31 a few years from now.  since the op is only available in 31, you want to get the 31mm dj so that it doesn’t feel so small that you will wear it less.",2025-04-05 10:22:18

they have done that and given us a new model (the first in decades), with a new bracelet, a “revolutionary” new movement, a fresh dial design and made it available in multiple materials, which to me was a surprise i expected for it only to be made in pm.

wich is ridiculous when you look at cars, bikes, boats, jewellery and other luxury goods.  
even the ceo of rolex stated that they create a product and not an investment.

people with real money do not care that much about the lower value of something. they buy stuff they like. and that is the point of buying. you buy something you like. not because of the resale value.  
the people that can afford a rolex and nothing else after that (yes, they exist and they are a much bigger group then you would think) they see it it as some sort of stock.

i even know 2 men that took a loan to buy a submariner. and that made me think that if rolex sells about 1.2million watches/year. how many of them are actually on a loan.

it’s ok to have 2 datejusts if they have wildly different configurations. these look similar with the that silver dial color. just keep one of those. drop the one you wear less. if it was me i would keep the one with the diamonds on the dial since it reads a bit dressier and can be used as your dress watch. but again, i love some bling when the occasion is right for it. 

keep the sub as your steel sports watch. if you want something else sporty next add in a new model with either yellow or rose gold two tone.

rolex does make iced out watches, but that's a lot different than spending 10-12k for an aftermarket iced out datejust that's probably a rep since you can't easily tell either way. if you insist on getting an after market iced watch, just make sure you can see it in person first, and confirm the setting of the diamonds is solid.

personally, i'd recommend an 80/90s solid gold day date, which is a little bit more money, and just as much ""bling"" factor, imo.",2025-03-19 05:21:37

IKEtheIT,datejust,"if its a 41mm you wont have much issues with getting finessed with a 1970's model bust down, since they only made 41mm in their modern reference numbers, you should be safe knowing a 41mm is a modern watch from 2009 or newer since that is when 41mm datejusts came out. make sure whoever you buy it from shows you the engravings on the case where you can confirm the serial # and that its an authentic rolex case and movement is really all you can do to buy ""a good bust down"" also the diamond quality and setting is huge factor in those, some cheap bust downs worth 8-10 they will try to pass as high quality for 12-15 dont fall for it 

if you were ever buying a 36mm, those started decades and decades ago, common finesse in nyc is taking an old 36mm datejust from the early 80's, ""bussing it down"" using an aftermarket bracelet, aftermarket case, aftermarket dial, aftermarket bezel etc... meanwhile inside it has an old ass movement.  basically making it look like a modern 36mm 116233 when really its an old ass 16013",2025-03-21 16:42:50

Outrageous-Ad-4194,gmt,"there’s no right answer. it’s all personal preference. 

i will concede that sd43/sub vs. gmt isn’t an apples for apples comparison; totally different use cases. 

of the gmts, the black/grey isn’t that interesting. if it were a pepsi (or coke if they ever release a new version), i would feel differently.

on dive watches, subs are dime a dozen. great watch without a doubt (i have one), but the base is ubiquitous and half or more people out there wearing one in the wild are wearing a super replica anyhow. 

for me, the sd43 is the coolest (and most interesting) tool watch in this group, and by far the coolest for a diver (yes i dive with my watches, mostly my omega seamaster). the markers all the way around the bezel, 43mm size (great for diving visibility even if people think it’s too big for wearing at the mall), built in hev (i know it’s not practical but it’s insanely cool engineering) and red lettering make this such a more interesting watch for me.",2025-03-21 23:34:00

selling watches back to them doesn't work.  it would just lead to ads having to pay out money to customers for the privilege of reselling their own watches at grey prices. like how would that work? i buy a submariner from them then walk over to their customer service counter and say i would like to sell you back this watch for more than i just paid you for it.  why wouldn't the ad just skip over selling you the watch and list it for grey prices to begin with?  they are never going to offer you more money than you paid them for the product but a grey dealer will.",2025-02-23 02:06:20

for example yesterday i wore omega seamaster to workout in the morning while i made sure the kids got ready for school. grabbed shower before going off to a private mauy tai session. i wore my 40mm yacht master blue dial since it matched better. 2 hour drive each way there. get home and switched over to submariner. then a little later switched over to the explorer and then at night i went with the submariner again. 

so i switch them multiple times a day with my outfits. i would say my go to is actually the omega seamaster as my beater. i actually find that way more comfortable than the submariner. plus the white and black go with anything. 

i also wear the root beer a lot. that watch is super comfortable. it’s so hard to say. but herr is my list in order 

1. root beer
2. two tone dayjust
3. explorer/ dayjust smooth
4. yacht master blue dial 
5. yacht master 42mm white gold
6. submariner 

i only put the white gold at 5 because i workout a lot. that thing sucks for working out 😂 probably not what they designed it for. now warm summer days it’s amazing. i honestly don’t think the submariner is all that comfortable. the seamaster blows it out of the water for comfort. the submariner my 9 year old loves. so it may just end up a watch i keep sized for him to wear. 

i just can’t let him take it to school. he is out there playing soccer or football at recess 😏 he has a limited edition save the oceans seiko diver with a beautiful dial he wears a lot. the clasp wouldn’t open one day he couldn’t get it off. he had so much dirt in it that you couldn’t open it. had to clean it out so he could even get it off. i said how did you get all this dirt in here. he says i play football and soccer at recess. we play in the dirt 🤷‍♂️ either way i will let him have the sub. i am not super impressed with it overall. 

long answer but it is too hard to pick one. the seamaster is my go anywhere watch though.",2025-02-12 20:35:58

love it wearing it now. i actually have my kids names and ages when i bought the watch at ad engraved on the back.

i would actually go with this over a submariner any day of the week. the case is so much thinner and it looks so much better. i honestly don’t understand why sub is so popular. this looks and feels so much better. love the way the platinum bezel adds that weight to the watch. it really is a beautiful watch. it was actually my first rolex from ad.",2025-02-12 21:47:44

Rolex_Art,gmt,"it is a long story, but i came across them casually.

my dentist wore one, my neighbor wore one, the guy that ran the finance division at work wore one.

and so i found myself in a situation where i was on one of the watch sale websites, looking for a birthday present for my wife, and i decided to dive into the world of panerai.

i saw one that i liked, and i said to myself, the next time i go to the mall and when i say the mall, i mean, the fancy mall.... pop into panerai and check it out.

i am thin but fit and have a 7 and a 1/2 inch wrist. i typically wear my rolex watches with 2 links removed only, and i was worried that a 44 mm watch would be too big.

i have a forty two millimeter explorer two, but when i tried on the forty two millimeter sky dweller.it just fit too big on my wrist.

well, i tried it on and turns out it fit. great, and my wife was with me. who happens to be a stylist? so if she says this is what looks good, then i cannot complain. the guy wanted me to buy it from him. i knew i could buy it online and save like three thousand dollars.and i ended up coming back and buying it from the boutique for more money.

it turns out a few days later. i went to dinner with somebody from work showed him the royal oak offshore. i was looking at and the luminar 1950 i was looking at and the next day he calls me and says send me the link to go and buy that luminar and i said, oh shit, the dude is gonna buy that watch. and i knew that he and i were going to dinner the next day, so i went and picked it up in person myself.

the same sales associate was there and i said, hey, my man, good news. i have decided to buy the watch from you. even though it's gonna cost me more money because i want the retail experience and i don't want a bottle of champagne opened. i don't want chocolates. i don't need a shot of some. type of tequila. i want you to give me extra bracelets.

so i walked out of there with a gorgeous read a. gorgeous orange and a gorgeous white rubber bracelet. in addition to the blue leather one, it came with and the blue rubber one.it came with. i also got tickets to an art basel event.

and i have to tell you, i love that watch so much.

i tell people that it retails for more money than a rolex sub, it also has a gmt hand it also dives as deep and it comes on a leather bracelet where the rolex bracelet is valued at at least $2000. so all the money for this watch, it's spent in the gears.

and as i go down the rabbit hole, although they all look the same with the same case, there are so many different variations, they even have many different day date variations. it's nuts some of the complexity they have, and i love does sapphire crystal exhibition case back. it is really hot to be able to turn it around. and look at the workings of the watch.

lastly, right now i'm wearing my all gold bumblebee, and i feel like the reason why i have it is that i stopped into the rolex boutique for the thousandth time and said to them. yeah, man, i wish you would sell me a watch. but you guys can't seem to sell me shit. so i just bought this pan next door. and now i'm going downstairs to automars, to look at a royal oak offshore, and the next thing you know, the dude said, surprise surprise we have and g m t coming in next week.

boom.",2025-02-15 14:41:51

a.  you appear to be very fickle considering the vast amount of watches you have cycled through recently.

b.  hulk is the worst steel rolex imo.  the wrong proportions, the supercase, the fat lugs, short power reserve, no ar coated crystal, imbalanced dial, cyclops, and too much green making it hard to coordinate with clothes.

c.  the no date submariner 124060 is the best steel rolex ever made.

steel bezel daytona coming back also makes sense, the obvious change would be the bezel markers but that seems like a very minor reason to discontinue it in the first place and delay the release of an an updated version for 4 years.... though could have been a calculated move to drive up hype for the daytona and get the precious metal pieces selling more aggressively.

rg blue dial dd seems like another low effort winner so it is believable.

rg sub is believable but the timing feels off, would have made much more sense if it was released along with the rest of the updated sub lineup.

bringing back the hulk so soon seems very odd, especially if it is alongside a rg sub it would kind of steel the thunder from everything else in the sub lineup.

caracs,gmt,"exactly.  sporturawus has apparently bought a lot of grey market rolexes he feels he needs to get on here and justify with ticket analogies.  meanwhile, i'm looking at my blnr i paid retail for in august after i walked into an ad in february i'd never been in before and told the saleswoman that i was looking for something to commemorate the birth of my first child in november.  i had a 114060 on (that i paid retail for) and bought a tudor gmt because i wanted one and never expected to hear another word from the ad about anything.  then she came through out of the blue 6 months later.  i told her my 40th b-day is in 2022 and a panda daytona would be the best way i can think of to celebrate...and her reply was ""we can make that happen"".  i guess i'm doing it backwards because i bought my wife a dj as a push present after getting the blnr, but who cares.  i thought ""getting in"" with stainless sport models was a pipe dream but all i had to do was find the right ad that wanted to help commemorate special occasions and saw i wasn't just some rando off the street hoping to flip a hot piece.  instant gratification isn't what i'm looking for, the chase is most of the fun.  could i just get on chrono24 and wire someone 30k for a daytona?...sure.  but i can also take that 30k and buy another watch i want and wear it while i may or may not get a panda daytona at retail.  if i don't it's not going to kill me.  with a little patience i'll end up with twice as many watches for the same money.  that new ed white 321 speedmaster and the bulgari octo brushed ss with the brushed dial coming out in may are fire.",2021-02-02 06:22:35

and, unless you're a vip with a pre-existing relationship, grey dealers are the only way average joe's like you and i can get our hands on a daytona, pepsi, or submariner.  it seems you picture them as shady types in trench coats and sunglasses working out of the back of a truck.  that's not how it is.  so, yes, i am quite proud of the fact that my grey premiums are helping small businesses survive in the same way they are proud that they get desirable watches onto the wrists of the most worthy enthusiasts.",2021-02-03 20:40:37

Desperate-Breakfast6,submariner,"walk in the store and look him in the eyes while wearing the watch you purchased there in ‘17. thank him. tell him how much you love the watch and tell him you would like to continue the relationship and would like another watch. 

then go home and on some nice stationary write a note and mail to him. thank him for the initial watch purchase and reiterate what you told him in person. send a nice bottle of wine via wine (dot) com. every 6-8 weeks stop in and say hi. send a xmas card. find out the sa’s birthday and send a small gift and a card. 

i got an 116610ln delivered via fed ex from an out of state ad that i never met by doing most of the above. i got the submariner less than 3-weeks after my first contact.

the large market ad is who sent me a submariner yesterday after my initial contact 3-weeks ago. 

try to stand out. dress sharp. speak smartly. be clean cut and nicely dressed. send a small gift and a handwritten thank you card. all 3 sa’s told me the thank you note really stood out. does anyone send them anymore? make them feel special and appreciated. ask about their hobbies, kids and wife. be genuinely interested and get to know them. it will go a long ways. 

i’ve spent < $750 on gifts, wine, etc and gotten 1 submariner and i’m 90% sure the other two ad’s will call offering me watches. i don’t count the cost of the earrings because they were going to be purchased independent of me needing a watch.

ddubb23,submariner,"yep, the sport models such as the sub are in very high demand and in limited supply at authorized dealers. wait lists are long if you want to buy at the rolex msrp. if you want now then you’ll have to pay a premium from a grey market dealer.

sporturawus,datejust,"datejust's that are two-tone or have diamond dials are pretty easy to find as they are not as desirable as the stainless steel versions with black/blue/grey/silver/white dials.

similarly, the smaller 36mm dj's are easier to find than the larger 41mm.

and the white gold fluted bezel adds about $3,000 over the steel smooth bezel so they are easier to find as they are more pricey.

Pepsi_Bezel,submariner,"the watches you are interested are likely reserved for folks who probably buy at least 3-4 watches per year, and potentially other items, from the ad,

folks who buy a lot of watches often travel, so even the duty free shops at airports have their steady customers.

if you go to an ad, i recommend against the pleading pauper approach, even if you have limited funds.  it is business for them.  

for the sake of your expectations, maybe look at watches that are hard to get but still reasonably attainable — submariner, explorer i / ii, etc.  — all great watches!

also, if / when you get engaged or married, it may be an idea to bundle rings with a watch wishlist purchase from a jeweler/ad.

good luck!",2019-12-25 05:42:02
noob_tube03,gmt,"i suspect the ads are as frustrated as the customers. they want to sell watches and make money, not play games. it doesn't do them any good to not sell a watch. i had the same experience as you, i wanted my first rolex to be a steel sports model, and i wasn't super picky (wanted a sub, seadweller, or gmt). every place i called would laugh, some wouldnt even tell me anything. going in store, the same thing. always a long story about no wait lists, no inventory, just luck of the draw blah blah blah. usually some pitch to buy a watch i didn't want.

&#x200b;

finally after a few weeks, one of the ads took the time to ask about me, and once he realized i was a local with money to spend, he took my info and my wish list. 2 weeks later, i have a no-date sub. his story (that i heard from a few places) is that rolex tells the ads, no lists, no taking over the phone, no ability to order steel models. but at the same time, to favor locals to prevent jetsetters from just buying up everything and causing headaches. 

&#x200b;

so my takeaway is, when you're on vacation, try the walk in/call ahead and hope to get lucky. that's what the bahama's are for right? but for your local shop, ease up. go in, let them know youre a local, and who you are and what you're looking for, and that might have better luck. i'm not saying you have to take them out to dinner to anything, it just flipped the switch for me at least between the difference of ""we have hundreds of you people in here a week asking for this"" to ""let me see what i can get you"" to tell them i wasn't just a window shopper from out of area",2019-09-19 16:48:56

any sports steel that are available will soften in their first couple of years then appreciate more than what you paid but only at around about the rate of inflation (ie nothing spectacular).

full precious metal you can get a discount then depending on which model (i’m thinking daytona’s) they sit at what you can lop off an authorised dealer and appreciate gently over the years, some of the more elaborate pieces may fall out of fashion (yellow gold being replaced by rose gold etc).

the bi precious metal (sky dweller white gold steel, rose gold / steel gmt) are a bit of an unknown, skydweller is going for overs but not sure if this is due to supply more so then the material choice and obviously the rose gold gmt propel just can’t get them hence them being £15k on ebay atm.

if you’re buying them to go up in value though then it’s a risky move, like with any bubble it’s difficult to call the top, similar discussions we’re being had in the late 80’s on sports cars and that all ended in tears (until quantitive easing about 20 years later but that’s another topic).

i just so happen to own one of each, having paid retail, taken advantage of forex and tax refunds. so all of these have 'gone up in value', but they are also current models that are in extremely short supply. so the market price of these has increased due to lack of supply. while by definition they have increased in value, it is the laws of supply and demand that are driving these market values. as a result, this inflated value could be temporary. but none of us truly knows.",2018-06-18 17:37:40

try one on in the store, and then look up the many photos that people have posted on forums.

some think the hulk will be discontinued, and others believe it will increase in value. i just think it's a damn awesome watch.

i wear it with pretty much everything. i also have a green everest strap that i put it on on summer.

Audiooldtimer,gmt,"it sounds like you have a quest.  
you never know how a quest will turn out, and it depends on how determined you are.  
years ago i had a quest for a breitling cwsle, a limited-edition and out of production. after checking 7 states i ended up finding one new at a dealer around the corner, go figure.  
i was recently tempted to pick up a rolex sub or gmt. at the same time i had a gold cosmonaute on consignment at a local jeweler. the breitling sold just as a ('14) batman came in, i grabbed it at $14.5k (with 2yr in-house warranty).

so, determine what you're willing to spend and whether you want a new or pre-owned and find it.  
call the guy on 47th st, call dealers, get on lists (people drop off). most jewelers have online sites use google.

if you’re really serious with getting a rolex then you’re going to have to do some footwork. i had to go to 4 different ad’s to finally be allocated a date just in less than a month without any purchase history. so it is possible, just gotta be patient. also another advice, there is no such thing as a “waitlist”, it’s really all about your first impression or your purchase history. my ad told me before that, it takes some time because they vet you out and make sure you’re not a reseller before allocating you a piece.

a.  prices will always go back up because rolex raises msrp’s and every year another 500,000 15-year-olds in 2016 turn 24 and are ready to buy their dream watches.  there is an endless supply of new customers on the steel watches we all covet.  

b.  no one was “speculating” on rolex watches and spending $27,000 on a gmt pepsi. that is a fallacy.  because there is no money to be made buying at a premium, and no authorized dealer would sell a watch like that to someone who needs that kind of low money. the people spending $27,000 on a pepsi in 2021 are the same people spending $27,000 on a pepsi in 2024. rich guys with no patience (raises hand). 

c. all this aside, the bottom line is it is no easier to get a decent steel rolex at msrp from an authorized dealer then it has been at any time during the past 8 years of rolexmania. if anything, things today are *harder* because all the rumors of a “softening” are driving tens of thousands of people *into* the authorized dealers to put themselves *onto* lists.  

and that’s really what everybody cares about. the ability to get a watch at list price. because the people who can only afford msrp don’t really care about the $3,000 grey fluctuation on a cermit.  “dropping” means nothing to them.  and getting a good watch from an authorized dealer is harder now than it has ever been.",2024-09-17 23:05:15

* diversify the collection. it certainly doesn't make any sense to me to have a submariner and a gmt, because they're basically the same watch. same with a sub and a dj or explorer - it's the same movement. ideally there is minimal overlap between pieces - for me, this also means looking at a brand, picking my favorite watch from that brand, and not buying anything else from them.

FutureVirtual6121,gmt,"for me it's the 124060 that is hands down the best model that rolex makes. it is perfect in every way over any other model rolex makes. especially in the symmetry dept. the extra 1mm in diameter is perfect for my 7.5"" wrist, the all brushed stainless steel bracelet is appreciated and a far better choice than the blingy pcls which easily get scratched (not something i particularly want in a tool watch), and the glide lock system is leagues better than the ez link extension on gmt master 2s (leagues) since you get way more adjustment length options versus just getting an extra half link adjustment.  i also love that i don't have to deal with the arduous and cumbersome task of setting the date on a gmt master ii, which as i'm sure you know, is a pita if you have a decently sizeable watch rotation going and the watch stops (and no i'm not going to put extra wear on the movement by using a watch winder). i love that the 124060 is just so grab and go. takes 10 seconds to set the time and you're out the door. i hate that the gmts don't have a quick date function. and lastly, the black noir aspect of the sub just literally just goes with every situation and every dress attire you can imagine. the most versatile and flexible watch in the enture lineup. there's just no beating the classic sub and it is absolute perfection for any other rolex. the most perfect rolex watch made currently. it's the reason the op got one before the gmt :)",2024-05-12 09:44:50

if there is an oversupply of a certain watch and the price is too high, nobody will buy one. if there is an undersupply of a certain watch and the price is too low, everyone wants one but there isn't enough to go around. equilibrium demand plus equilibrium price is where there are enough watches for everyone that wants one at a price that everyone is willing to pay.

look at longines or omega. their stores do not use these kind of tactics and their brands do not have a big grey market because their ads are able to meet equilibrium demand, meaning that if you go into one of their stores and ask for a watch, 9 times out of 10, they will be able to give it to you. if you sell it on the grey market that they do have, you might get back what you paid for it, if that, because since the ads are able to meet equilibrium demand, nobody would pay you above equilibrium price for one.

longines and omega ads are able to meet equilibrium price and demand because longines and omega suppliers make enough watches and set the suggested retail prices to do this.

ads typically cannot meet equilibrium demand for rolexes, in particular the most desirable models, because rolex as a brand likes it this way. they do this intentionally and not all ads get to pick the watches they get sent, and they only get a few of the most desirable models. if they all got 50 daytonas a month, they would be able to satisfy equilibrium price and demand, but then the daytona would be no more exclusive than the speedmaster.

clerkp,gmt,"the house will come down when the economy cools and production increases. it’s happening but it’s very very slow. it remains to be seen whether rolex will throttle production to avoid too much inventory to try to keep prices higher. most rolexes can now be purchased at, around or even below msrp. only a handful continue to trade above msrp but prices are way down and continue to come down. my guess is rolex will limit production of desired models for fear of the hype train passing them by.  so a gmt and daytona are probably staying over msrp indefinitely. the rest may end up at or below.",2024-03-29 20:33:56

Professional-Elk8762,gmt,"there isn’t a problem. what’s the problem? you haven’t defined one. we are talking about purchasing expensive baubles, here, not insulin. what is the problem if some people can’t buy a rolex? that everyone can’t get what they want sometimes?

let’s take your idea to its logical conclusion - if rolex operated a first-come, first-serve deposit system for their watches, then they would see waitlists many years long - possibly a decade or more - for their most demanded watches. demand is that disproportionate relative to supply for things like steel daytonas and pepsi gmt’s. so your solution would ostensibly have individuals giving interest-free loans to rolex (or its dealers) for indeterminate periods of time, on the promise that they might get the watch they want at some point, for whatever it’s price might end up being, and so long as it wasn’t discontinued. meanwhile, anyone who didn’t join the waitlist at the time you opened it would be effectively sol for getting the watch at all - unless they buy it on the grey market. how is this any better from the current system?

it’s so easy to be upset that you might not be able to get something you want at a price less than it’s worth, but folks love to complain about it until they are challenged to propose a ‘solution’ to the ‘problem’ of not enough rolex watches. and literally nobody in my experience can profess even a marginally realistic ‘solution’ when challenged on this. there is a reason for that.",2024-03-30 06:25:12

and this is a good thing.  because if the jewelry buyers didn't liberate the good steel rolexes from the ad's, you'd never get one.   see, they would go to rolex vip's who spend $100k on rolex watches instead, and they would wear them, never let them loose.  

so, yeah, hate the process if you like, but believe it or not it's actually why you get a shot at a decent steel rolex at all.  your ad only gets 3 gmt pepsi's per year and has 300 people on waiting lists that would be 3,000 if they didn't cap it.  it's never going to be you.",2024-03-07 21:10:04

that said, most ads do play some games and have a stockpile of the hot watches in their safes, reserved for the vips (i've witnessed this first hand when a sa produced a rootbeer for a vip from the back).

sure, if you want a watch no one wants, like a dj36 on the polished bracelet with diamonds, that segment that took off during the pandemic has dialed way, way back.  but no one wants the crap.  they want the good stuff.  and nothing has changed nor will it change on the good stuff.",2024-03-01 16:17:28
Nihur,gmt,"you need to open yourself up to other models. if the model you want is one of the sacred 15, it isn’t happening without purchase history. open yourself up to models beyond something like an op41 which the blue/green of those models are on the list i mentioned. consider another dial color on that model and watch how sas start treating you differently. the flippers have dissipated from the models that aren’t on that list and sas i’ve noted recently are more opening besides wos and bucherer (at least for me.) 

i know it sucks but that’s just the way it is. i recently got my gmt only because of my connection to the ad otherwise i would’ve been in the same shoes as you. if all you want is that one watch, i would honestly just pull the trigger on the gray market. it’s only worth doing the dance if you see yourself needing that relationship for future allocations.",2024-03-01 17:20:16

brownboypeasy,gmt,"i think it depends on what the ""vig"" 10 percent over retail? yeah why not.

the gmt market is insane. pepsi's are going for $23k right now. while i get that rolexes are a prestigious watch and if you want something you should be willing to pay for it, but i wouldn't buy any $23k watch let alone one that is $11k retail. mind you this is mostly artificially created by rolex. gmts are harder to make sure, but they could easily shift resources to meet supply and they choose not to. 

i think we're in a little bit of a never ending cycle. i get why people want to go grey but the growth of the grey market also hurts the retail market. i still don't truly get how that benefits rolex but they still sell the most watches worldwide every year so they probably don't care. at the end of the day, everyone has to do a cost benefit analysis of what a rolex is truly worth to them.",2024-02-20 18:41:46

i think i got lucky that my new sa (previous one left) wanted to meet my timeline for the submariner. it was for a work milestone.

since then i told them i wanted a dj41 green dial fluted on jubilee. she was nice about it but when i went to check in with her i found out she had quit and now i would be onto my 3rd sa in less than a year.

i’ve checked in once and they don’t seem to care. i think i am done with rolex as i find it annoying to have to be “checking in”  i have one and i’m fortunate to have other nice watches too.

my brother got his dj41 blue dial smooth bezel from coffin in about 8 months. ben helped him out and i knows he’s been there a bit.

Westwood_1,gmt,"if you only want one watch, get the vintage 16710. holes or no holes, they're great watches and will easily last a lifetime - and as a bonus, the bezel inserts are swappable, so you can buy an all-black model and swap the insert to a pepsi for not too much. i've recently seen 16710s listed for as low as $9.5k (a great deal), but remember to add about $1.5k for a rolex service that will have your watch looking as good as new and functioning well for the next 10 years.

as for your dream, as a first-time buyer of getting a new 126710blro from an ad... forget it. there are always anecdotes from people who claim to have purchased a gmt as their first piece, but they are the very rare exception, not the rule.

are you the kind of guy who has an impressive linkedin? are you local to the ad's area? are you old enough that a spouse and kids are a possibility? are you the sort of person who presents extremely well? do you give off ""i have money and i'm going to spend it with you"" vibes?

those are the people who get gmts as first watches, and even then they are insanely lucky. most sales associates get to sell no more than a handful of ss gmts a year - which is probably enough watches for 1% of the people who come in and ask for a gmt over the course of the year. smart sales associates save those watches for people who are their big spenders or who they think are likely to become big spenders.

just wait for a good 16710 and send it off to rsc to get refurbished. you'll get a great piece for less than the msrp + tax on a new pepsi.",2024-02-13 00:02:45
Best_Concept3339,gmt,"i would just go to every ad in your area and see which one you like the most or gives you the time of day. i tried the just walking in approach with no luck, then i actually scheduled an appointment with another local ad for shits and giggles to see if they had anything i liked in stock. went to the appointment, i gave them a rolex to get serviced and bought diamond earrings for my wife for christmas. we tried on a few watches, and the ad rep asked me what 3 watches i wanted. just got a text over the weekend for a 40mm rose gold with black dial ym. bought that and put in a request for a sub with green dial for my dad. p.s i asked for a daytona and a sky dweller off the bat along with the ym. she said the daytona and sky dweller are for people with spend history. she was super upfront about it, which was cool. i figured i was never going to get a watch. i've been a wait list for about 2 years for a root beer gmt at another ad. 

i do not dress like i have money fyi; think that's a common misconception with people's advice on here. i wore sweatpants, gym shoes, and a hoodie to the first appointment, and when i bought the ym over this past weekend. also drove my work pick up truck that is dirty asf and parked right up front by the door. all the b.s about dressing like you have money etc is lame. your money is just as green as everyone elses.

i personally haven’t bought anything from him before, only my family has and not really many rolex, it’s more so for jewelery and we haven’t been frequent clients the past few years so i assume he said that to gatekeep the pepsi as it is the hardest gmt to locate. also said sprite would take longer to get, but i wasn’t interested in that watch thankfully.

what’s probably happening is the manager you are friends with like mine, wants to do you a favor of helping you cut the line but the problem is pepsi is that one gmt that is reserved for top top clients at your ad in a given year(s). so he’s saying it’s discontinued because it’s better to tell you that over tell you that you aren’t getting that watch straight up. he’s trying to deviate you from the pepsi into another gmt that isn’t as gatekept.",2024-02-03 18:55:26

4.  as you will never get a gmt at msrp in the uk there is very little roi possible as you’ll be buying at the high.  yes, you may be able to sell this and make £5.000 in 20 years, but you won’t need that money then so take this silly “investment” concept out of your head.",2023-11-21 11:53:54

this is just my opinion, so it might differ from others but you just asked!
i sorted it from „no chance“ to might be good from ad and grey would also be okay. 

i would forget the gmt and starbucks, they are too hard to get and the grey market premium is hefty. 
the sub date (ln) is a safe and solid choice for sure, goes with everything and could be obtained from an ad. otherwise the premium grey is not too bad.

datejust is also a really good choice, for me the fluted/jubilee combination is nice to see, but too much as a daily. i have mine with smooth and oyster, feels like the most hated combination here. but it’s a great everyday watch, has the date and a good power reserve. not to flash, i wear it all the time. the 100m water resistance is also enough for swimming and stuff, i basically never take mine off. 

the explorer is too boring for me, it feels like there is something missing but could be easier to get.

i'm not seeking a batman/batwoman, a blue & gold sub, or a platinum day/date.

all i want is a blue dial/smooth bezel/jubilee bracelet/oystersteel datejust in 41 mm. ref 126300.

i've been trying to get my hands on this, two of them actually, for the better part of two years.

it's an $8,300 watch. i'm not asking to buy a $100,000 precious metals watch or whatever.

yet, every time i ask one of the 6 ads whose ""list"" i'm on, i'm told that i'm trying to buy a watch that is nearly impossible for any ad to get their hands on.

so, i decided to look at the gray market.

jesus christ, all the gray dealers have seemingly dozens of them. new in box with papers, etc.

i'm admittedly new to the rolex world. so maybe i'm missing something. it seems odd that i could buy 20 of them by lunchtime if i go gray. yet, 6 ads in 3 states can't manage to get their hands on any of them. what am i missing guys?

there seems to be $2,000 - $3,000 markup on the gray market watches which is a little irritating, but what is the ""opportunity cost"" or loss of enjoyment and cost for waiting around on an ad to get one they will sell?

rolex watches sell themselves. it doesn’t matter if you buy planned to buy 10 gmts. they don’t need your business. literally tens of thousands of people across the country would kill to buy that watch. it’s sold before it ever went in the case.

ads need customers that buy high margin items that are hard to sell, not low margin items that are easy to sell.

also, nobody here is talking about begging. they offered him a $13k watch at $10k retail within 3 months. with the promise of then selling him a $20k watch at retail within six months. what exactly is so pathetic about taking that offer? if you really want to say screw them, buy both watches and sell the sub for a profit.",2023-09-18 03:42:23

i definitely think you have a better chance of purchasing one from a smaller place as when i spoke to one of the sales reps which we had a really good talk with and they have gone out of their way every visit we've been to have a chat with us it doesn't seem like they have too much influence or decision making over allocation as opposed to the smaller ad's.   


i decided to purchase a tissot prx from bucherer in the meantime just as a decent daily watch as that jeweler store i visited twice didn't have anything i liked at all so i wasn't going to just buy for the sake of buying some shit without any guarantee i'd get the watch i wanted anytime soon.

BarbellPadawan,gmt,"sounds like you wanted all those watches so that’s cool. my understanding is depending on the area it could still be very difficult to get steal gmts and subs even with what seems like a decent spend history. i really want a sub 126610ln and i’ve thought about this long and hard. i was originally planning on buying a tudor pelagos at my ad (i like the blue dial ti version for sure, but primary reason for said purchase would be to “build the relationship”… and since i only want to have 5-6 great watches in my collection i don’t want to waste any slots on watches i *cannot* live without).  so i have decided if i don’t get the call soon (~1 year or so) i’m going to go grey. it’s only a 4-5k premium right now to buy a new sub on 2ary market which is less than that pelagos, and let’s face is, one 5k watch purchase might be meaningless to them anyway. if i end up getting the call i’ll get the new sub from my ad as well and essentially average down my basis and then re-sale the used one, maybe trade it in for another watch i really want like an omega dark side or speedmaster ‘57.  sorry if this thought process is asinine to anyone.  i’m not upset with ads or anything, and while i can be patient, i can’t really deal with the unknown of being on a possibly mythological list.  if it were a reality of: ‘hey we get about 10 of these watches per year and you’re 25th on the list, so anticipate about 2.5 year wait’ that would be totally cool. but having a complete x factor and not knowing if my buying shit there will even help, i cannot mentally handle that myself.  the gmt batman is sick though. if i get the sub through ad i’ll probably try to get on interest list for one too.",2023-08-24 22:18:34

also, the bracelet felt more robust and the ez on the fly adjustment comes in handy because i like my watch snug but can get tight depending on my salt intake, etc.

zulu/gmt was not a standard reference that was set for funsies. it was set for utility that clearly enough people had as to set an international standard for it

Daedeth,gmt,"well you know there is some bias here in this group lol. but i think the elephant in the room is the size difference. 46.2mm is no joke. you definitely have to have the wrist to even consider that watch as an option. the 7-day power reserve on the big pilot is nice if you have a larger collection, but imo it’s a bit overhyped as it’s just a time/date watch, and setting it isn’t a big deal. there is a bit of a disparity in the water resistance favoring the batman, if that makes a difference to you. the big pilot has double sided ar coating, which is a no go for me personally, as those light scratches you get on the outside of the crystal drive me mad. for me it would be the batman for the following (personal) reasons: 1. the gmt functionality is actually quite useful for me. 2. i prefer the bracelet (even if rolex still refuses to give us glidelock on non sub based models…) 3. you can’t ignore the value retention issue 4. ar coating and wr as stated previously (i swim quite a bit, and while i know 60m is *probably* fine for most of what i do, i like the peace of mind) 5. the batman is thinner by 3.6mm. that’s not a small amount (though i imagine this partly due to the larger mainspring they had to fit in there for the 7 day power reserve)

i will say though, i can’t stand the pcls on the batman, and would opt for the jubilee (batgirl) if given the choice. hell, i’d buy a 97200 bracelet to put on there.

b.  it is only available on the pcl (polished center link) oyster bracelet.  the batman and pepsi are also available on the jubilee bracelet which is an important consideration because in the future you'll have a lot of oyster bracelets and not a lot of opportunity to get a jubilee.

to answer your question, no, you cannot just walk in to an authorized dealer and purchase a new steel rolex just for asking.

sporturawus,submariner,"you have to go back to 2015 and back then if you were lucky you could walk in and find a submariner or a batman and just buy it off the shelf. that all changed in 2016 with the release of the daytona ceramic and 2017 with the release of the pepsi ceramic. the combination of those two releases is what started rolexmania and things have been insane ever since then.  note that no one could ever walk in and just buy a pepsi off the shelf. it was immediately waitlisted with hundreds of people begging for one. batman was launched in 2013 so it had cooled off by the time you got to 2017.  

as for the future, the combination of the false rumors of a rolex ""crash"" and the new certified preowned program are sending people *running in* to the ad's like never before.

\- you've got thousands of people who didn't think they had a chance putting themselves on waiting lists for a watch at msrp.

\- you've got thousands of people who now feel they have a safe place to sell their 3+ year old rolexes because they never trusted grey dealers.

\- and you've got thousands of people being put on cpo waiting lists which now become a necessary purchase as a gateway to maybe/not-really chance at one at msrp.

popular models are a little more obtainable today vs post stimulus 2020 to summer of 2022, yes you most likely need some sort of history but with the profit of flipping sliding daily a lot of speculators are turned off. i also think it will take some time (maybe years) for ads to put them back in the case. the proposition of buying jewelry or less desirable pieces to drive revenue is a golden goose these dealers aren't going to willingly give up.",2022-12-20 16:04:31

this is why so many of us just go to grey dealers. we don’t want to wait years, our time is more valuable to us than a couple grand, and there is no point in building some sort of purchase history because all of the watches you want don’t count towards the purchase history.  all you will do is waste money and years and not wind up with your batman.",2022-12-10 17:57:21

edit: full disclosure- i’m still waiting for my no date sub lol. i just started a new job so after the new year i’m going to be going back in to check out the pelagos 39 and maybe see if i can switch my request to a cermit (daughter has green eyes). wife’s birthday is in february so i may also look to pick something out for her.

but when i went in i made an appointment and got to work with the owners daughter. this is a good summary of what the conversation was like.

our conversation started with me explaining (and this is a true story) that my grandfather passed away a few months before my daughter was born. in actuality one of the last things that i told him was that my wife and i were expecting. so when he passed i inherited his tag and i wore it the day my daughter was born. shortly after i did some close inspecting and i discovered that it wasn’t genuine (grandparents and fakes, am i right?). 
anyway when my second daughter was born during covid i had picked up a tudor bb gmt to wear for her arrival with the intent of passing it down to her. i explained that while the sentimental value couldn’t be matched monetarily, i felt a little off about passing down a fake and would like to acquire a sub to be true heirloom. 
from there the conversation went on to the current state of rolex availability (this was back in july when things were already slightly improving), other watches in my box, my sinn 103 classic 12 that i was wearing at the time (i joked about how it could hold me over for when i grew balls to ask for a daytona), watches in her collection, tv shows we both enjoyed and her upcoming wedding. 
finally before i left i got to speak with her dad, one of the owners. i had brought in my grandmothers watch as it wasn’t working and i wanted to find someone to repair it so that i could give it to my sister so that we could each have a watch from our grandparents. something else about this part- yes i wanted to get it working and still am looking for someone to take a look at it but i also wanted them to see that i do but sentimental attachment to items like this and that my wanting to get a sub is not an attempt to just flip it.",2022-12-07 19:20:30

i was thinking of stopping into the shop in the next couple weeks and looking at the longines they sell/ potentially buying one. is it awkward if i make it obvious that i'm looking to buy a longines to help my name on the list? i've always liked longines, but never had a desire to buy one. would buying one actually help my status?",2022-11-30 14:12:31
redmosquito1983,gmt,"this is how it went for me too. went to one of the bigger ad that has multiple locations and said i was there to buy a gmt or sub, got laughed at and was asked if i had purchase history and told they usually reserve “special” pieces for high end clients that buy more than just watches. i told him that’s a shame because i have $10k cash in my pocket and was looking to buy a watch today, and whoever sold me that watch was going to get my business for future jewelry purchases. but since they couldn’t sell me a watch have a nice day and if you change your mind feel free to contact me. 

most of the other local ads were quite polite and added me to “the list” which to my surprise i haven’t heard anything from them in 2 plus years.

Mustang_1982,gmt,i tried it on at a boutique and it’s amazing.  i also think best gmt.  and quite frankly better than a two-tone daytona with the black dial.  the watch almost looks angry.  i think it’d go great with a suit or casual.,2025-04-10 16:43:05

sporturawus,submariner,"this ""correction"" you're talking about already happened.  only 15 of the 1,360 watches rolex offers in the catalog these last 10 years of rolexmania ever held their value or increased.  the other 1,345 have always been money losers.  foolish younglings pushed those two-tones and small sizes and diamond dials and 50 year old datejust garbage way up in 2021 and they've tanked 50% since then.  they've already floored.

but what about those 15 ones everyone wants?  here's a fun fact:  they don't decline at all.  no date submariner is currently $15k and that's the highest it ever has been.  pepsi jubilee is $27k and it's been there for the last 5 years.  election, pandemic, another election, nothing changes.

why?

because the people who can afford these things at grey prices are also immune to a recession.  see, we don't sweat a bad week, bad month, bad quarter, bad year on our portfolios.  we understand how this works in the long run.  we don't go buying $2m houses when our portfolios jump up 10% and we don't stop buying $20k rolexes when our portfolios drop 10%.  we don't even pay attention to these 'panics'.  it's just that simple.

so since those of us who can afford grey prices don't stop buying and since the vip's who get the hot steel pieces for msrp from ad's don't stop buying, you are no closer to getting anything at msrp yourself and the grey prices don't budge.  with tariffs, they're going to likely go *up*.",2025-04-08 03:23:38

the bezel and dial are two very different shades of green. they don’t feel far enough to be contrasting or close enough to be matching. the black against green provides a stark contrast. 

i would say it’s subjective not objective.",2025-03-30 07:29:41

LostSpecters,gmt,thanks for your support! i think what helps a lot with the ad as well is being specific on what you want. from what i’ve seen from talking with my guy when someone walks in and says i want any of these 4 gmts if they come available they get put on the back burner. each watch in each color and bracelet has a list of people that want that exact specific one and those people will get priority and bumped up “the list” faster,2025-03-28 13:16:42

Cull_Obsidian_,gmt,"forgot to add: whilst all pepsi bezels should be red, aluminium service bezels provided by rolex are blue backed.

so if you’re ever unsure about whether a bezel insert on a gmt is legit or not, ask the dealer/owner to pop it off (it’s easy and safe, can be done with a guitar pick) and that should at least give you an indication if it’s an rsc bezel insert or not.

also: rolex in the uk won’t do bezel swaps for gmts anymore, other than a like-for-like in the case of damage. you used to be able to get them for £25 before the pandemic!

they still do bracelets, and this was the kick up the see i needed to do it, as rolex japan now don’t do bracelet swaps either (they’re technically separate countries that make up their own rules).

- i wanted to have an indépendant gmt hand over quick set date. the hour hand moves so fast( minute hand doesnt move while changing date if you want just the hour hand )  that changing the date is quick and easy, not like some make it sound that you have to wind and wind and wind the hour hand.. also, that is personal but i did not want to have to turn the bezel and not having it unaligned, maybe my ocd, but bezel looks good on 12 o’clock. i track 2 time zone all the time so i want to have my bezel straight :) older models don’t have indépendant gmt hand so anytime you want to track two time zones the bezel has to be rotated. 

i wanted to have a no hole case and solid end links. makes it more solid imo and doesn’t rattle as much. 

acrylic glass looks nice and vintage but i preferred sapphire crystal for its robustness. 

i wanted to be able to use the super luminova if need be. not dropping 10k+ on a piece and have half its functions ( figure of speech) 

happy with the 3185 movement. 

i do not regret it at all!!!!! bought it from jacek tropicalwatch: and it looked brand new, factory polish , papers and haven’t taken it off since. 

i hope this helps, a lot of it is a matter of preference. 

let us know what you go for or if you have any questions.",2024-11-16 19:07:56
Watch-guy-TX,gmt,"why does everyone get a sub and a gmt?? i’m not saying that they aren’t both amazing watches,, but i feel like it’s basically just buying the same watch twice. the only difference between sub and gmt is the extra hand and different colors. they look like the exact same watch. why not get something completely different,, and not diver-style??",2024-11-16 15:01:21

i am a rolex wearer and have for the last 20 years.  buying a submariner in the past wasn't the ordeal it is now.  now that i want a more expensive rolex -- without rehashing everything that has already been posted -- i'm either going gray or possibly moving to a different brand.  luxury goods manufacturers need to ensure an outstanding customer experience.  rolex is failing here.  sire, their short term profitability has probably been boosted.  but long term -- they are really pissing off their customer base.",2024-11-09 21:55:32

datejusts are easy to get and hard to get at the same time.   and you’re looking for the hardest one of all. 

the problem is that rolex offers 733 different datejusts in the 2024 catalog and the average authorized dealer only receives 85 of them *per year*.  so it’s a needle in a haystack situation if you focus in only on one size/color/dial/metal/bezel/bracelet configuration.

it’s worse because you are seeking a dj that is high in demand with a long waiting list. open yourself to other variables and your odds increase markedly.  also consider emailing our trusted sellers as they can track the specific configuration down for you for a reasonable premium:

no.  you won’t. there are only two people who get a gmt pepsi:

a) vip who pays msrp + $100k in jewelry to an ad. 

b) non-vip who pays msrp + premium to a grey dealer.  

that’s it. those are the only people getting the good steel rolexes and they both pay the premium.  one through jewelry, the other via cash.  no average joe walks in off the street and gets to pay $11k for a gmt with a street value of $26k.  it’s ridiculous to even have that fantasy in your mind. the ad’s aren’t in the habit of giving away free money.  they aren’t stupid.",2024-08-05 08:17:39

former rolex sa here.  no, you don't.

most rolex ads avoid grey market dealers like the plague.  this doesn't mean there could be one or two bad apples in the bunch (racketeering case in chicago, lawsuit against shreve, etc).  the reality is that most ads want to preserve their orj status because rolex is the main source of foot traffic into their store.  the smaller ads that balk at a $250,000 renovation are ones that rolex will eventually cut off anyways.  for christ's sake, one big ad in my region (sf bay area) spent almost that much in a year just for parties/gatherings/accommodations for their international vips visiting the us.

i've been aware of some backdoor deals, that is true, but it's not this big conspiracy with grey dealers that you are claiming to be.  usually, it's some employee that needs some help with down payment on a car so he chooses a specific client to allocate a gmt pepsi in exchange for a few thousand dollars.  but that client is almost always already a trusted and long-term one anyway.  you may be asking why that client doesn't simply get the pepsi if they're already a whale but the reality is that there are other whales they still have to compete against.

but it's always the exception, not the rule.  we don't have this cartel-like pipeline pumping millions of dollars worth of daytonas and gmts to grey dealers, lol

the main thing to always be aware of is that the big ticket items like the daytona will **always** be prioritized for vips simply because we want those vips to keep shopping with us and to keep them away from our rivals.

need_rolex,datejust,"> the reason some have and keep relationships is bc they take the “dogs” along with the daytonas and pepsis. they can go and try to lose a little as possible on them while selling the bigger pieces and making the margin.

that's only true around 2019 - 2020, at least from my experience and the experience of my sa friends working in the bay area at the time.  i remember one particular client that did just that and i thought i hit the jackpot.  little did i know that the person was just flipping everything.  my manager cut them off when our rolex rep warned us of some pieces hitting certain bst groups in facebook at the same time.  that was also the time when we can still keep stickers on the watches if requested by our clients.

today, rolex ads have wised up to those methods.  go to an ad and tell them you'll buy up their lady-datejusts if they also let you buy a daytona that same day and see what they say.  chances are they'll refuse you despite the profit potential.  it's just too risky for rolex ads nowadays, especially with rolex's recent ruthlessness towards ads.

> at the end of the day, to think ads are just selling bags of daytonas to bobs watches in exchange for bags of cash is way oversimplifying the whole game. now “pairing” a new daytona with that 3.5ct if engagement stone, eternity setting and set of wedding bands, or maybe with a full pm and diamond dial and bezel 31mm dj and a pair of earrings? that’s where the watches are going if you want to make real generalizations. and from a business standpoint it makes perfect sense.

you hit the nail on the head.  most daytonas in the grey market came from regular clients that decided to flip.  and we don't bundle daytonas with jewelry purchases anymore.  too risky.  if the client is new and still a stranger to us, we'll let them buy up all the jewelry they want.  if they start asking about some tit-for-tat deal, then we don't give them any concrete promises.  we just try to be as vague as possible with their daytona.  if they're true with their intentions, they'll buy their jewelry and be willing to wait for the daytona.  but if they're a flipper, they'll back out of their jewelry purchase as soon as they realize they are not getting a daytona that same day.",2024-04-28 18:02:11

i hate to break it to you, but there will always be some form of deception in business and life in general.

when there is money on the line, either side will keep information to themselves for as long as it's advantageous.  it's true during critical negotiations in a multi-million dollar enterprise deal.  it's also true when a complete stranger shows up in your store asking for a ss daytona off the bat.

> they sit on watches in the safe and manage inventory as standard practice - some legitimately and some not.

of course!  but that's because we always want to make sure our vip clients are taken care of first.  if they suddenly have an itch for a daytona, the worst thing that can happen is making them wait too long and they start making appointments with our competitors.  so we always make sure we have a few ss daytonas and blros in the safe just in case.

we don't hoard them for some vast, backroom conspiracy with grey market dealers, lol

also never assume that any year or model of a specific model watch like a steel pepsi gmt are equals. my case a point about the 2018-2024 steel ceramic pepsis out weighing previous year models is 100% visible in current price points for old vs new model rolex pieces. best example of this can be shown in the 2018-2023 steel ceramic daytonas. that watch has not had much of a change in its movement since the early 90s, yet 2018 steel ceramic daytona sell for over 30k all day, while discontinued steel daytonas from 1990s-2018 sell for 20-25k. there’s really only one big difference…. the ceramic bezel!!! now go even further and ask yourself “hey if i could land the most in demand currently produced steel rolex of all time (ceramic daytona) now at 30k with massive rumors and ad supply numbers dwindling insinuating that discontinuation is near do you really think that prices will not go crazy…?

BigFonz64,gmt,"here y'all go. broken into paragraphs


okay, so this is a 1985 gmt 16750. it's broken and i've had it serviced twice in the 12 years i've owned it. each service cost over a thousand to two thousand dollars, even though the watch wasn't broken at those times.

there's a crazy story behind how my gmt got broken. i also have thousands of dollars worth of accessories for it, including a jubilee bracelet currently on it, the original oyster bracelet, the original dial and handset (relumed to glow in the dark again), and four different bezels. the one pictured is the original, and it's pretty unique. i also have a black fat font, a black thin font, and a new pepsi bezel.

knowing this, i'm going to tell you the story of how it got broken and then you guys can help me decide what to do next. should i fix it, and if so, how? should i wait until i can afford to have it professionally serviced again, or should i try to open it up and replace the crystal myself? and if i do try to fix it myself, how should i go about that?

long story short, two years ago i was being robbed in my home. the person robbing me threatened me with a deadly weapon, and i blocked it with my wrist. that's what damaged my watch. i was then arrested for attempted murder because i shot the person in self-defense. i spent two years fighting the case and beat it in court last november. that's why the watch was in an evidence locker for two years.

i'm lucky to be alive, much less free and still have all my rights. but this incident bankrupted me. in florida, statistically, in 2020, out of 2,000 cases just like mine, only 280 of them were found not guilty. so, the watch is a reminder of a terrible time in my life that i never want to forget.

would you guys fix the watch? right now, i wear it as a reminder. but considering all the extra bezels and bracelets i have, the value of the watch itself is somewhere between $12,000 and $30,000.

i'm just looking for some friendly advice. the watch is a reminder of how bad things can get, but it also reminds me of when i got a promotion and finally bought myself a rolex, something i had always wanted. i traveled a lot for work back then, so the gmt feature was perfect. and the reason i went with a 1985 model is because that's the year i was born. basically, the watch stopped working the exact moment i had to defend myself. it was either me or him.

if i were to get it fixed, i wouldn't be able to afford professional service right now. so i'm trying to figure out the best way to do it myself. i wouldn't mind replacing the crystal myself, but i'm not sure how complicated it would be to open the watch. i'm pretty handy though. i've built everything from cars to houses to restaurants, veterinary clinics, and even strip malls. i also used to work in telecommunications and built mainframes and dc power plants for companies like at&t and verizon. so i think i could probably take the watch apart and keep track of all the pieces.

Crafty_Bunch6063,datejust,"i think you are mixing corruption with relation.

still, i get your point.

while there is a thin line in between relation and corruption, still a line. mentioned this in another response. couple of differences:

-  relation gives trust to seller knowing that watch is not going grey anytime soon. sometimes their choice on who they sell the watch to is as simple as this.

- relation is build when you buy watches that you like, to wear them, regardless of their resell value. when i walked to that ad i asked form a pepsi, a batgirl or an explorer 2. i could have said ki wanted only a pepsi or a daytona. and then move to others if thats no possible but from the begining i mentioned that if i could only get the explorer i would be happy about it. that builds trust to the seller.

 - our ad keeps our warranty for months (sometimes years if we dont remember him) we do not care because if there is a problem watch goes there. they avoid flipping. i see this as a good practice and only dealers would complain about this. 

 i am not sure if my post has been misunderstood. my family purchase is not daytonas and pepsis. its simple watches to celebrate life moments (ablue dial datejust when my sister finished medicine, things like that) i still waited 7 months for the batgirl and if i would ask for another watch in the next 2 years they would not give it to me.

again, not 100% fair, i get it. but this is absolutely not the same that a corrupted system selling watches in packs, from the ad, with a price that should be ilegal coming from them. absolutely not the same than what i described.

what happens in hong kong is a completely different thing. waiting lists do not exist. ad’s inflate the prices themselves. non popular models are stored to inflate prices.

lastly, relations are nor something related to rolex per se. if you want the  new omega speedmaster in white you will have to wait (i will have to wait)  people with relation with the ad got it. i think is normal. same for leica. if you want the best table in the most popular table on a restaurant on a friday night, maybe you won’t get it unless you are a regular. this is not corruption. we are talking about a different thing.

at the same time, he was confident that he could get me a batgirl in less than 3 months, so i went for that one and i recently got it.

my impressions from my talks with him are:

-  pepsi is still in production, but they recieve very few. i could have insisted but even with history the wait could have been a year or more.

it’s also a smaller case diameter which makes it easier to wear daily.  

i said speedmaster because that will stay in your collection longer due to its heritage.  

very few (since you’re young) end up a one and done guy, and you won’t feel like trading it in after a few years because it’s so iconic.

parkADV,gmt,"hey, this is my favourite watch advice thread ever. tons of context and information on your preferences.

first, an important question - have you owned a mechanical watch before or have they always been quartz? does the idea of having to keep the watch wound or having to re-set the time if you haven’t kept it wound annoy you? this might change my answers for you. that being said, here’s a starting point:

my first pick for you would be watch 4 - the prospex solar diver. it’s got classic styling, the prospex line is great quality for the cost, and the solar movements in seikos are extremely reliable, accurate and low-maintenance. what’s your hesitation on solar? that may impact the decision.

my second pick would be watch 2 or 3. this will depend on your preference for gmt complications. if you go with a gmt, i’d recommend watch 2. black/grey is very versatile - a subdued but tasteful watch can always be worn with a colorful outfit, but the reverse isn’t always true. gmt is great for some people - i have friends living in other timezones so i love having my gmt hand set to their local time so i always know what time it is for them. if you like that idea, or if you travel regularly and want to keep track of what time it is at home, a gmt complication is great.",2025-04-04 18:21:17
bosco1603,gmt,"whats your wrist size/preference towards the size of the watch?  i'm assuming based on your collection you prefer bigger chunky watches.

the seiko 5 gmt's and number 3 will all be the same size at 42mm, number 5 will be the largest at 45mm, and number 4 will be the smallest at 38mm.

all the automatics essentially have the same movement, a variation on the seiko 4r3x.  its a durable work horse and when it comes time to service the watch, it'll will be cheaper to flat out replace it then to service it.

1 or 2 would be the safe bets.  if you find no use in tracking a 2nd time zone, i would go for 4 or 5 depending on the size preference.   number 3 just looks like a genertic sports watch pretending to be a diver to me, i think 4 looks more like a real tool dive watch, and the blue is more attractive.  and the dial and case design on 5 is the most interesting in the bunch.",2025-04-04 19:04:01
neonlithic,gmt,"the seiko gmt looks really nice in person, and looks much more expensive than it is. the seiko turtle is also really good value, but it’s pretty big which limits its versatility unless you have huge wrists. i would get something boring and versatile. you can always add a colourful strap if you like that, but i would find it annoying having to coordinate all outfits around a bright yellow watch or one with rays on it. for these sportswatches i would just get a black dial. blue can work as well, but is already so much less versatile. i think a blue dial looks awkward with a black outfit for example. a black dial is just so versatile both with other colours and different contexts and levels of formality. i don’t wear a lot of black clothing either, but i still prefer a black to a blue dial when i’m wearing green or grey, and blue can look a bit too vibrant and attention seeking if i’m wearing sporty or outdoorsy clothes. the seiko gmt is also particularly nice in black because the gmt bezel texture still makes it two tone (sort of black and grey) so it’s not as boring. blue and red can look nice in a gmt, but seiko doesn’t make one like that. maybe it’s just the combo of a warm and cold colour that makes it match with more. i would get the black gmt.",2025-04-04 19:39:12
parkADV,gmt,"good to know! since you’re good with an automatic, the black/grey gmt could be a great option that looks rugged, classy and a bit sporty but could go with almost anything.

the prospex solar watches have a power reserve that lasts about 9 months on a full charge, and you should get a full charge easily with a day’s exposure to light. not sure how that compares to the mvmt watches but they’re very low-maintenance. if you prefer the convenience of the solar movement with a bit more color, that blue prospex diver would be a great choice.",2025-04-04 19:09:55

gmt master ii would be my second pick because it has two useful complications that the explorer doesn't. red/blue isn't as versatile as black, but considering most guys wear lots of blue anyway, the versatility difference is marginal.

Tae-gun,submariner,"several issues/problems here (perhaps due to an unjustified application of navel-gazing to everyone else):

1. depending on the watch/marque, there are many mechanical watches out there that are just as affordable as some quartz watches (e.g. seiko - particularly the non-flieger snks - and orient). hell, in comparison to many of the dropshipping and fashion watches, many mechanicals are even more affordable than these.

2. speak for yourself, but for me (and for others with whom i've actually talked about this) one of the major draws of mechanical watches is that they're not designed with planned obsolescence in mind, whereas the vast majority of quartz watches and movements are. this means mechanicals/automatics can be maintained indefinitely (depending on the movement or the complexity of the repair, one can do this for oneself) so long as parts or parts sources remain available.

3. asserting that ""watch enthusiasts are obsessed"" with extra functions is a blanket generalization, and one that is inaccurate. not only does this depend greatly on the watch (consider the preferences people have for the submariner date v. no date), but there are plenty of complications that are polarizing in terms of enthusiast preference (consider the posts here from time to time about hot takes regarding least- or most-preferred or least-useful complications).

4. **pulsometers have always been a gimmick**. none of the attendings, residents, and even professors emeritus with whom i've spoken ever recalled the use of a pulsometer, nor could they recall a time when either they or someone they knew (e.g. their own professors and attendings) wore a watch with a pulsometer track. physicians who wore/wear watches just count the pulses over 6 seconds and multiply by 10 to get a patient's heart rate; it's that simple. nowadays physicians don't even do that, as pulse oximeters and other combination machines (and even a patient's own smartwatch) can get that information. this is not a knock on people who like watches with pulsometers, but some of them are probably not aware that pulsometers were never widely-used or even considered by the medical profession.

5. what do you consider ""good"" at a hobby? if watch *collecting* is the hobby, how does one define proficiency? is proficiency in a hobby (which is ostensibly for recreation and is not a profession/competition) something to be aimed for/achieved/preferred?",2025-03-11 13:30:17

op - if you like it, go for it! it is a beautiful, quality watch and you won't go wrong. nevermind the rolex homage nay-sayers. if you research squale, they have a history unique to themselves that dates back to the 50's, when recreational dive watches took off in popularity.

i really like some designs like the 300 and the weird montauk ( a collaboration with long island watches i think go figure), but at those prices/movements they are hard to justify i think.

i’m of a different mindset than this sub on this topic - i don’t think direct homages are  okay - in my opinion, if the sale of the watch is mostly contingent on the design success of someone else, it’s not okay. i’m always being downvoted for this opinion. i absolutely despise brands like san martin who literally steal designs to sell watches. 

that being said, i think squale gets an easy pass because if their history and the fact they’re not 1:1 clones like some other watches - this one uses a different hand set which is huge. those with mercedes hands has a while different dial

to me, this and squale as a whole is on the “okay” list of homages.

edit - i’m seeing many say about it not scratching the itch. 

i think if you’re buying as a temporary place holder, it’s an expensive one. 

i own multiple rolex, but i also own squale. 

i think squale can hold its own independent of rolex.

dwindlingpests,submariner,"i disagree with that. how do squale not have history? they date back to the beginning of recreational diving, they made cases for other brands like blancpain before making their own watches and now they produce capable professional divers that are emblematic of the 60s-80s era along with brands like zodiac and doxa. squale are also moving upmarket with the new bracelets, the recent titanium 50 atmos, the cosc certified 50 atmos and the carbon fibre t183. if you bought a 50 atmos a few years ago for 800, it has not depreciated to 400. it has probably retained it's value if not slightly increased as they now retail for 1100-1300. they do also seem to sell well on sites like chrono 24. 

the idea that squale swindles newcomers to watches like fashion watches do absurd. are brands not supposed to exist in the range expensive than a 300 dollar citizen promaster and less expensive than a 10,000 rolex submariner? 

talking of resale value if you buy a cheap citizen ecodrive promaster or seiko 5 and beat it to hell, no one would want to buy it anyways despite the brand recognition because a new untarnished one is so affordable retail and even cheaper gray market because they are made in such quantity.

citing christopher ward as having a better reputation is strange. they are marmite. some people hate the logo, some people love it. some people like the name, others really dont care for it. also christopher ward have grown so much in such a short time that their infrastructure has not had time to grow in regards to maintaining customer support for all of the additional watches they have sold to many more customers all around the world.

i am a big vintage fan for the feel of wearing a unique watch and (if i'm lucky) grabbing a bargain. the flip side is you have to be willing to take on a steep service cost and a watchmaking willing (and able) to work on the older movements, some of which are manual. you can find some beautiful pieces that still run neat as a pin. bulang and sons have some in current stock that come fixed up and with a warranty (never bought from them personally but i like looking at their catalogue). you can also browse on chrono24 and you can set limits on price points and dial colors, size, and then just browse. white and black dials can fly under the radar a lot of times with the right dress style.

if you don't want something that old or a more modern rolex, there is the air king, the 1500 models (think datejust). my advice is also don't overthink this. unless your rolex is decked out in diamonds and massive on the wrist, chances are most coworkers won't notice it. people easily recognize rolex because it's the most well-known watch. the nurse taking a blood draw saw my vintage gmt and asked ""is that a rolex?"" and we got to talking for a bit (because it turned out he was a watch guy), but the air king with the white dial or the explorer? never had comments or even lingering glances on those and i dress with my sleeves rolled up half-way on my forearms.

ok, i'll change your mind. send it in for warranty service and rolex will fix it. the low amplitude issue is an assembly problem, likely because of the company stretching its resources to produce more. the flaw is that they're not oiled up properly, for whatever reason. 

i've sent in a couple gmts and several datejusts for this issue over the last 4 years and they've come back working quite well- strong amplitude (270+) and tight timekeeping (within +/- 1 seconds per day). as the company prioritizes warranty work, each watch has come back within 3 weeks, despite the 6-8 conservative estimate. as human watchmakers are the ones overseeing the service/repairs, the movement parts are oiled up sufficiently.

also, neovintage watches have the 31xx movements. you're referring to the 32xx movements, of which *some* have the issue you're referring to.

GrouchyExile,submariner,you’re not going to mention price? a submariner is $10k and a seamaster is like $6k new. so you’re arguing that rolex makes better movements than omega like that is a surprise but to even get into a rolex you have to spend almost double what a base omega costs.,2025-01-18 20:44:03

let’s go point by point on their mass produced movements

accuracy: rolex is -2/+2, omega is 0-5 or 0-6 depending on on size. rolex is tighter and averages closer to 0

rate: rolex is 4hz. due to coaxial, omega is 3.5hz a slower rate. 

antimagnetism: omega has rolex beat here at 15k gauss vs rolex’s 10k gauss. both are way more than you need, though

service interval: omega says 8 years to rolex’s 10 years. so coaxial didn’t give a longer service interval one of its main raison d’etre 

thickness is often acknowledged. omega watches are thick, even when they are hand wound like the speedy. 

finishing: people often say rolex doesn’t finish its movements. total nonsense. attached is a photo that shows perlage and beveling, **even in the areas you would never see **. omega makes the top plate look pretty, but sand blasts basically everything else. 

personal anecdotes, i track my watches accuracies and as an example i’ve included the last week of my 20 year old gmt master. incredible accuracy for a vintage piece.

the op is simply cleaner and more sleek. simple bracelet and clasp, clean dial, smooth bezel, no date window. however i t’s obviously more difficult to obtain and you’re looking at probably $7500-$8500 for one that’s relatively new with both box and papers on the gray market if you can’t get it from an ad",2025-01-10 21:13:53

about a month ago, i was officially named head of blah blah [redacted for privacy] at my job and to celebrate i decided to take my parents to europe on our first adult child + parents trip! and while we’re here in london, i pulled the trigger on this early 2000s coke bezel 16710. it’s got the no holes, solid end links case and swiss dial with superluminova. 

five digit rolexes are my favorite, and i’ve seen these described as the peak period of “tool watch” for the brand, before the colder modern bling. picked it up from watchfinder who were awesome to work with. the price was a little higher than the watch charts number, but i’ll take the authenticity guarantee and two year warranty. running beautifully at +1 sec a day and 290+ amplitude dial up.

therealserialninja,gmt,"yup like i said it's not a quality issue, or even a capability issue (e.g. in-house vs third party movements - i mean, cartier has a ton of quartz models, they're still luxury). 

to my mind, ""luxury"" is really just a branding issue. rolex, cartier, etc, are branded as luxury items - it's how they define themselves in the market. tudor, etc, have for a long time been in the mid-market segment, although their design language and quality have improved a lot and tudor is certainly starting to push into the luxury space with higher prices, big endorsements, etc. i'm particularly a fan of tudor's fxd line and longines gmts. 

when i suggest getting a ""luxury"" watch, i'm not talking about capability, quality, even price point. i'm suggesting buying a watch with luxury brand cachet, simply because it's a nice way to turn a utilitarian gift into a heirloom - again, not that you can't already do that with a regular watch, but the luxury puts a bit of extra kick to it. whoever receives it treasures it not only for sentimental value but also because it is independently ""luxurious"".",2024-11-26 16:10:04
billgatesmills,gmt,"my father and i would go every week to a or two watch shop and browse the new, pre-owned, and vintage sections for years before i got a watch. we would spend hours. i had no idea he was going to get me a watch for my high school graduation, but i used to really enjoy looking at the longines and its unusually lugs.

for the omega, he and i really enjoyed the teak dial pattern. we liked the vintage omegas, but the newer models and warranties were more appealing. we probably visited the shop for a few months while i decided on the dial color and case size. 

for the datejust, that was a pre-owned model. we were looking at the air kings, double-signed dials (like tiffany stamped dials or dominos and winn dixie editions), but i really like the blue dial of the rolex and jubilee. we had been looking at rolexes for a year before we bought that.

for the patek, we looked again probably over a year at various boutiques. i looked at lange, pateks, and vc dress watches. once we liked the patek boutique experience, it was between the one at tourneau and tiffany. tiffany only had the 5196g with the stamped dial available. i thought the tiffany stamp was awkwardly placed within the subseconds dial and much rather preferred the clous de paris pattern, exhibition caseback, and rose gold of the 5119r, so we ended up with that after a month of debating.

the rest were my father’s or wife’s preference for their gifts, and i didn’t want to provide any input.

the 1675 and ming were just cool watches to me, and the only 2 i’ve bought online. i bought the 1675 from a trusted vintage dealer with a brick-and-mortar store. i debated between the daytona, sea dweller, day-date, and gmt master for 5 months—all were more or less in my budget on the second hand market ($5000-$8000). i thought the daytona was hard to tell time on, the sea dweller lacked color, and the day-date was too blingy for everyday wear, especially in my low position on the totem pole at the time. i really liked the added complication of gmt  and the bleached blue model was added to their site. the ming was bought after i read the hodinkee story.

i bought the cartier after debating between the jlc reverso and tank, wanting a rectangular watch in my set. i spent about a year deciding between the two, and i like the proportion and quartz movement of the cartier. i saw the black dial at the boutique and preferred that over the white dial with the roman numerals.

we never felt any pressure from the associates, and we never put our name down for any watch. watch stores used to be mostly empty when i initially got into watches, expect for a few people geeking and nerding out.

the next year i was on holiday in greece, and keeping an eye out for a rolex but it was impossible to find one, obviously. i was applying for a new job at the time that was quite a big jump in title and salary and i got the offer while on holiday. the jlc caught my eye instead and actually got a decent discount from the ad. was a fitting watch to celebrate the occasion and i wear this watch frequently to the office.  
felt like i was missing a sports watch but wasn’t quite ready financially for a rolex. luckily my wife gifted me the tissot. i wear this basically whenever i feel it’s not safe enough to wear the rolex. this watch gets a lot of compliments as it’s quite popular with other watch enthusiasts.  
finally, the long awaited rolex. i was aspiring for a rolex from the very beginning but needed to wait for the right moment. i always wanted a submariner but once i learned about the 16710 it changed my mind. love that you can swap the bezels and the bracelet, and adds a bit of colour to the collection. very lucky to have this gifted from my wife as a wedding gift.

and microadjustement if you meant for rest size there is a toy adjustment you can make with the gmt and it fits me better than my dj jubilee. im a sucker for 16710 or prior ( i like the independent hour hand ) sel and no holes.

the tudor gmt is cool, also cheapest of the bunch.  it's just, i have never been a tudor guy.  the hour hand annoys me, the pepsi color looks so old etc etc.  not my first choice of colors.

in terms of takes on the grey market - go on chrono24 and ensure you’re only buying from professional dealers with a few hundred 5 star reviews. it’s highly unlikely you’re sold a fake if you stick to that route. 

people who end up buying a fake usually are looking for the absolute cheapest possible watch, and ignore all sorts of red flags in pursuit of that. be willing to pay market price from a reputable dealer and you have no worries with buying a fake. i just bought a rolex from watch limit on chrono a few months ago, great price and 100% authentic, i’m sure you could get a sub no date from them if you look them up",2024-10-30 12:04:22

PetrosD60,submariner,"this will be an unpopular opinion...

tudor was never what it is today. it even left the watch market in the usa for about a decade in the early 2000s. their reestablishment in the usa, and their rise in prominence globally, coincide with the increased difficulty in buying a rolex, which many suspect is artificially controlled by rolex.

tudor was originally created as an affordable alternative to rolex. instead, it has become the available alternative to rolex. can't get your hands on the submariner? buy a black bay 58. can't get a daytona? buy a tudor black bay chrono. can't get an explorer? buy a ranger.

tudor would be nothing more than another bremont if it weren't associated with rolex, as the available alternative. regarding pricing, rolex was always relatively close to omega pricing. but what they've done is pushed rolex prices higher and higher, and have now positioned tudor as comparable to omega.

the best way for tudor to grow is to make it difficult to buy a rolex, and have a sister company that you can buy instead. it was the perfect game plan and they executed it to perfection. marketing people do what marketing people do. 

i think i would never buy a tudor because i would only ever see it as the rolex i couldn't buy. besides, that snowflake hour hand is god awful.",2024-10-10 05:11:57
Dark1000,gmt,"great watches with excellent movements and other mechanics, leaning into tool and vintage aesthetics at an excellent price. the designs are derivative, but as a rolex-owned brand, i think that's fair.

sometimes thet make odd design decisions that i think purposefully make their watches worse so as to avoid competing with rolex.

the faux riveted bracelet is an example of this. it's an unpopular and nonsensical design element that just pushes them a little out of rolex's sphere. it's the same with the long time it took to produce and deploy an on-the-fly adjustment mechanism.

the worst example is their case shapes. the slab-sided cases make already thick watches look and wear much thicker than they should. these are just not well-designed cases. it's clear that this is unnecessary because of watches like the bb58 gmt or new black bay metas, which are significantly thinner (though still look bulkier than they should). this is why tudors look so good head-on and generate such interest but end up at a huge discount on the secondary market. the wearing experience is not as good as reviews, photos, and videos show.

on the other hand, tudor can also do what rolex won't. they can release watches with old school bezels. these aren't as robust or as desirable by everyone compared to rolex's ceramic bezels, but they are desired by some. they can make something new, like the pelagos and all it's derivatives, like the fxd. so there's a trade-off to avoiding the overlap with rolex.

if you are happy with these compromises, that they aren't the rolex many buyers want in their heart of hearts, that many of their watches look and feel thick, that the design elements reflect rolex rather than a unique design language, then they are great watches. they still look great from the front and are better made than just about anything else at their price level. the movements have the best specs at the price and work extremely well, the bezel action is top notch, the lume is super bright, the new bracelets are excellent, etc).",2024-10-10 06:58:32
spitfyre667,gmt,"i like them a lot. the times i had my hands on them, they also felt like good quality. 
i think they suffer a little from their reputation of being “rolex small sister”, in both ways. i think on one hand, while the new prices are fine compared to other watches some used prices seem a but inflated and i also caught myself when thinking about buying a tudor ranger that i could also wait and safe more and then get a explorer. that’s not the fault of the ranger but the marketing just seems pretty similar. not saying it’s the way it is but sometimes feels like that although i know it’s stupid but buying a watch is a pretty emotion-driven thing and you can’t always turn that off.

but they also have a lot of very interesting stuff! the pelagos is great and high up on my wish list (i have enough divers currently but if i would get another it would be close between pelagos and po). also, the white gmt looks great on the pictures and the ranger looks much better in person and is still on my list! 

as a brand that seems to be more flexible than its larger sister, i would love to see a take on something more unconventional, comparable to the breitling aerospace and omega x33.

Jesseitsmyname,gmt,"tudor is what rolex used to be....a tool watch. they have a cool history as the ""poor man's rolex"" when considering their adaptation in us military, french too, and were definitely a smart move made by rolex. 

rolex relies on a tudor to compete with other brands too (cough, omega) by getting metas certified. it also uses tudor for proving grounds on things like a titanium watch (pelagos then a ti yacht master).

as for the watches, the quality is there and you can tell they're held back a bit by rolex....the bracelets with faux rivets everyone hates, the slightly thicker (14mm) than needed chrono's. however, newer models and the pelagos line are really taking shape.

as a company they do have some pretty weird designs here and there. the tudor ranger i think misses pretty hard. the black bay 58 gmt i think actually misses a just a little bit because of the use of gilt. there is also the north flag which is just strange. i like that they try a lot of things but some of the designs seem awfully odd.

flawed logic. the same could be said for the speedmaster. the inconvenient fact for your ""argument"" is your statement isn't true. the bb58 sells well because well....there was a 1958 ref? tudor is part of the wilsdorf organization and has superb in house manufacture movements from kinessi. nothing you say will change these facts. everything you've said is conjecture at best - fictional alternate universe.

secondly, tudor is still priced lower than omega.

third, rolex has left the watch enthusiast circle and is now being catered to rich folks who can afford to drop a random $10-20k on messika jewelry so they can get a $10k stainless steel watch at msrp. increasingly, rolex is pushing precious metal and the ss options are more for long time established customers.

i don't think the average person looking to buy a pelagos or bb58 is trying to buy a gated submariner. myself and friends in my circle all have rolexes but some of us still buy a tudor because its more low key and a great everyday beater.

>i think i would never buy a tudor because i would only ever see it as the rolex i couldn't buy. besides, that snowflake hour hand is god awful.

that's your prerogative but most would disagree. but if you want to talk fugly, how about omega remove that nasty escape valve bulge from the smp. or the fact that the daytona (automatic) is thinner than the speedy (manual). give tudor some time and it'll be funny if they make an automatic chrono thats the same thickness as a speedy pro. the tudor enroachment on metas is great. competition is great. maybe omega will get off their asses now.",2024-10-10 15:05:14

EH86055,submariner,"sorry for the misunderstanding.

the design's aesthetics are completely subjective and there are, as you noted, a lot of thoughtful alignment & proportion details on the modern dials too. calling it incongruous was just my opinion, i should have added an ""imo.""

my main point was only that the edges of square/rectangular markers, and the edge of the hour hand, are parallel at each hour to increase legibility (esp, in the dark). that was likely the original reason to have a flat hand end, which is why losing the flat markers misses the design's ""intention."" obviously it's not possible for a straight line to be parallel with a curved one. 

usually, round markers are paired with pointed hands as the alignment can be judged by seeing the distance between the outermost point on the marker, and the tip of the hand. so in modern tudors, snowflake hands are probably used more for brand identity and aesthetic than functionality--nothing wrong with that. the difference is negligible anyway.

worth noting that on the original snowflake submariner dial, the diagonal axis of the diamond is also at the same radius as the large markers, in a similar manner to what you described on your bb 41. so many of those alignments/concentricites were also present on the vintage dials.",2024-10-10 05:46:03

i'd also want it on the jubilee with t-fit clasp, as the bracelet it comes with is a little subpar in comparison. i don't do bracelets without an adjustment mechanism anymore.

submariner for stronger resale (assuming you get one at retail) . end links are better on the sub. rated accuracy and power reserve is better on the sub.

i owned the pano date but found i started preferring smaller divers. so now own a breitling superocean which i feel is the perfect fit for my wrist (7.5 inches)

crusader_____,submariner,"i don’t understand the glashutte seaq, the only people who really love it are hipster-ish commenters on reddit. 

it’s a nice watch, but no different to me than an iwc or a sinn. people make it out to be a submariner killer but it’s just another slightly quirky watch with subpar metrics. a 55 hour power reserve in this day and age, for $11k+??

for that kind of money, the end links should really match the case in design and finish. the case has radial brushing and the bracelet has linear, so it creates a jarring separation.

those arabic numerals don’t look bad but they’re not nearly as timeless as the sub’s iconic dial

up until recently, the seaq was heavily marketed by the swatch group for having a breathtaking movement, which was completely hidden by a closed case back, which i think perfectly encapsulates the decision making of the swatch group and the designers of this watch.

edit: this thing has a 40 hour power reserve. no wonder it hardly sells",2025-03-29 02:22:19

Dark1000,submariner,"this is my big frustration with the seaq. the smaller version is not nearly as great as the larger version, lacking the big date and with an older movement, but the larger version is enormous. there's no goldilocks. also the bracelet doesn't taper enough, though that's a small point. and the warranty is too short.

the submariner, while lacking so much elegance of the seaq, is that goldilocks perfection in size and design. it's not nearly as nice, but the sizing wins out.

if go could just stop with the 3/4 plate, shrink the thickness down by 2mm, the diameter by 2mm, it would be such an easy choice. i would unequivocally call it the best diver made today.",2025-03-29 02:11:50

1. this is an s-tier two-watch collection.

Prudent_Candidate300,submariner,"it’s almost guaranteed that your watch has sat unused for months before your ownership, during or after the manufacturing process. it’s perfectly fine.

unless your watch is sitting unused for literal years, then you decide to wear it constantly, there’s no risk for damage to the movement.

for those who don’t service it for 37 years, they have a watch that does not run as accurately as it should, and the movement is in poor health. that is a fact, despite its variations in accuracy.

for your rolex submariner, i’d say you are safe with a service interval of 7-10 years. you may want to go on the shorter end of this guideline if your watch is frequently exposed to variations in temperature, moisture or saltwater.

a watch will need to be serviced every 10 years or so regardless of it has been worn or not. the oils dry up, even if the watch was never worn.",2025-03-17 18:49:42

**rolex submariner**  
this was a bit of a grail for me, as you can see i love dive watches and the sub is for me the pinnacle of divers. waited about 18 months before i ""got the call"". probably the best made watch i own, the tolerances are incredible and it feels indestructible.

**omega seamaster 300 heritage**  
purchased this for my 30th and is by far my most worn watch since i have it. i love the technical aspects of the watch, with the insane anti-magnetic properties, double barrel with 60hrs of power reserve. next to the movement the watch itself is also a technical marvel, ceramic bezel with liquid metal numerals, sandblasted ceramic dial with laser cut-outs filled with lume. i actually quite like the polished center links, which seems to be a gripe people have with this model. love how they merged with vintage inspiration with modern tech. probably my favourite watch.

**omega seamaster 300m diver**  
was looking for a watch for the weekends / holidays, and i really wanted a rubber strap. love the case shape and the lightly domed crystal. and the tech is amazing again with ceramic bezel and dial, with the laser etched waves. have to say that the movement in the 300 heritage (8400) looks much better than the 8800 in the 300m diver.

**grand seiko sbgw267 / asakage**  
this was my wedding watch. very classy and elegant, with an amazing design and pattern on the dial. part of the light & shadow two piece collection that was exclusive for the european market. the dial is the absolute highlight of this watch, and it actually has a slight dome shape, with the hands also being curved to match. this is my only manual wind watch.

if you purchase the watch for a look or as a status symbol then it’s probably not important cause the watch is “jewelry” as some people have stated already.

if you use the instrument for its intended purpose, then it’s probably more important. 

remember these were once tools used to explore the most rugged places on the planet. 
hillary wore a rolex when he reached the summit of everest for the first time.


i worked as a dive professional for a while in bali. taking tourist diving 6 days a week. i wore a rolex submariner on every dive. i would use my bezel to keep track of our halfway times. as well as to get an estimate of the air consumption of the guest on the dive.

in peru i decided to hike along the train tracks to get to machu picchu instead of purchasing a ticket. the rolex bezel was again used to keep track of the incoming trains along the tracks (every 33-37 minutes in case you’re wondering)

that all changed around 2005 when they seemed to shift to more bling with less concern for retained value.

i've noticed that the other 20-30yr old models are barely worth what i paid for them (at retail)

on the other hand, i bought a rolex daytona in 2005, preowned, for $7,500, and 3yrs ago i swapped it with a dealer for a rolex submariner, and gmtii - steel & gold - which became holiday gifts for my sons. both appear to be worth more today than the $20k (total) value of the deal.

ZhanMing057,submariner,">i mean it’s basically patek’s slogan, about how you never own a patek, you just look after it for the next generation.

the dirty secret is that at some point those watches hit exponential growth in servicing costs, so your kids will either have to wear it exceedingly sparingly, or be prepared for high service bills, each of which could probably pay for a nice mechanical watch with better movement design.

> a cw sealander with a sw200 movement for example is made out of pretty much the same material as a submariner. if you looked after them in the same way, surely they’d both last a lifetime right? what about a steel microbrand watch with a miyota, seiko, seagull movement inside?

Tiny_Personality3847,submariner,"i took possession of this rolex submariner 16800 this week. my good friend of 7 years is an older gentlemen whom is a collector, and when he offered to pass it along to me, i couldn't resist.

getting this was a milestone for me that was symbolic for me as well. i first got into watches at 21 when i was in the army. a colleague showed a cheap fossil brand skeleton watch that i fell in love with at the time, and then when i got it myself i started going down the rabbit hole. during this time, i met a local gentleman through a masonic lodge and he was into watches, and i learned a ton about the actual luxury watch market through osmosis. i later purchsed an skx and rocked that for a few years.

after i transferred to a top 3 private university in the us, i got an omega po first generation (ref 2200.50.00) to celebrate struggling through my first year in school and coming out of my first internship at a big name hedge fund that i networked myself into. i rocked that throughout school. i had come out of a legitimately hard year. i lived in isolation during covid, lost a good friend to suicide, and failed my first classes when i first came in. when i got the po the following summer, it seemd appropriate.

i graduated this year and although i had interned for 3 years, i decided not to join the fund due to it restructuring and me not really seeing upward potential as an analyst. the other leads i was pursuing my senior year didn't seem to have the timing right. i graduated without a clear idea of what i was doing; i knew what i was interested in but monetizing it on the open market was proving troublesome. for a few months, i would wake up every morning feeling terrible, go to the coffee shop, ""work,"" rinse and repeat. i kicked myself for not doing the traditional recruiting that college students go through. i had wanted to focus on my research projects (got published too as an undergrad) and was counting on there being something in my network that would bring me on. for months, it seemed my calculus had failed.

during the summer, my friend let me borrow the watch for some high profile local public events i was attending and i fell in love with how the sub mastered its proportions and was so versatile with outfits. when i first started collecting, i would remark (and he'd agree) that rolexes were worn by those that didn't have exposure to ""real"" watchmakers' brands, was coasting off brand value, etc etc. but in the watch connesiuer's journey, rolex seems to be something that people return to because it just... works.

a couple months after graduation, i reconnected with one of my old bosses from the c suite at the fund, and he told me he wanted me to come work for him at a fund he joined. 5 months after graduate, i started working for him as his direct report as he resturctures the business. i think this all has been worth it. as my po served well in school and in my internships, i discussed this with my collector friend and we agreed that this transition deserved a new watch as well. it also was apparent that my po didn't fit as nicely underneath my shirt as a sub does. i'm still breaking into the job right now, but i love where i'm at in life. my friend sold me this watch to celebrate that transition and new job. i am fortunate that based on our 7 year friendship he is letting me pay in installments.

he himself got it with box and papers a decade ago in nyc. it is a 1980s sub with tritium dial that is long gone in terms of lume, but he got a watchmaker to stabilize the markers on the dial and on the hands so it'll stay in this condition for a long time.",2024-11-24 23:28:53

metroidpwner,gmt,"i hope this doesn't come across as rude but if you're looking to drop up to $25k, you should really do a lot more homework on what's out there, even before giving too much weight to the opinions that you'll see on this subreddit (which typically slants more entry-level). that budget is quite large, and opens up an enormous amount of options.

do you want dressy, or sporty? consider that sporty typically comes with better water resistance and features like  a screw down crown so you can take it in the pool and take baths etc *(before anyone chimes in that water resistance doesn't apply in the pool or bath or shower, you are wrong, that is outdated/outright false info)*

is brand cachet important to you?

you say gold vs. steel might not matter, but consider that steel is a bit more durable and gold typically comes with dressier watches. 

you say that this watch will be for special occasions only, but if you drop that much coin on a watch, will you find yourself wanting to wear it more? if so, a more durable every day watch may be suitable (think rolex submariner or omega seamaster compared to a patek calatrava or breguet).

metroidpwner,submariner,"i hope this doesn't come across as rude but if you're looking to drop up to $25k, you should really do a lot more homework on what's out there, even before giving too much weight to the opinions that you'll see on this subreddit (which typically slants more entry-level). that budget is quite large, and opens up an enormous amount of options.

do you want dressy, or sporty? consider that sporty typically comes with better water resistance and features like  a screw down crown so you can take it in the pool and take baths etc *(before anyone chimes in that water resistance doesn't apply in the pool or bath or shower, you are wrong, that is outdated/outright false info)*

is brand cachet important to you?

you say gold vs. steel might not matter, but consider that steel is a bit more durable and gold typically comes with dressier watches. 

you say that this watch will be for special occasions only, but if you drop that much coin on a watch, will you find yourself wanting to wear it more? if so, a more durable every day watch may be suitable (think rolex submariner or omega seamaster compared to a patek calatrava or breguet).

No_Influence_9389,submariner,"space travel lacks the gravitational force (more accurately the normal force opposing gravity) to make automatic winding work, the bodies of pressurized water to make water resistance necessary, or the yuppies to be impressed that would give the submariner any advantage.

CA53W-1,submariner,"watchers,

i've been diving into some space history lately, and one question keeps coming up: why didn't nasa pick the rolex submariner for the apollo missions? instead, they went with the omega speedmaster, now known as the ""moonwatch.""

the speedmaster passed rigorous tests, but the rolex submariner seems like a strong contender too. by the 1960s, it was already a legendary tool watch, trusted by divers, military personnel, and adventurers for its durability and water resistance. if it could handle deep-sea diving, why not space travel? rolex’s reputation for ruggedness was well established long before the apollo missions, so it’s surprising it wasn’t considered.

let’s be real, the submariner is one of the most iconic watches ever. its black bezel, clean dial, and mercedes hands would have looked amazing in lunar photos. the speedmaster is a classic, but the submariner's style would have taken those images to another level.

if i had to choose, i’d go with the submariner. its heritage, timeless design, and tank-like build would have made it the ultimate moon watch. imagine neil armstrong checking a submariner as he took that first step — it would have been iconic.

what do you think? did nasa make the right call with the speedmaster, or would the submariner have been a better choice?",2024-11-12 17:47:43
Schmuf84,submariner,well i would say that they wanted to have a chronograph for the crew which actually turned out to be more usefull then a divewatchnwith a betzel. maybe a daytona instead of a submariner.,2024-11-12 18:12:16

IndicationFast2592,datejust,"if you’re not looking for a foofoofoo look at me olalala then santos is out. 

personal and unpopular opinion but i don’t like the way the aqua terra fits for some reason. idk if it’s the thickness. not really sure. i have average sized wrists( 7 inches, not particularly flat or round). was going to pull the trigger on the shades but got to try them on and the fit and polishing put me off. anyways it’s a cool watch. 

this would leave the speedmaster and the iwc for me. i have tried both on, and i like them both. i would wear both. with that being said, given a choice between the two i would pick the iwc. another unpopular take :) the bracelet, finish and fit are all spectacular. it’s not in your face blingy (especially the matte black), but it looks damn good and is no slouch.  i also prefer the minimal, more conservative flieger asthetic so again, personal preference here. imo it’s a solid and more conservative alternative to a datejust.",2024-11-06 01:00:18

Low-Relative6688,submariner,"these are like the 5 most dissimilar watches to be considering so just be honest with yourself about why you're buying the watch. is it the performance, the brand cache, to add a different style or complication, etc.

1. i would lean speedmaster just because a chrono is very different from a diver, and it's a bit dressier than the rolex (partially polished links, polished pushers, etc) and it will overall hold it's value long term better than the others. it's iconic.
2. it's nice to have a different dial colors and the at is definitely dressier than the rolex or speedy. at is probably the closest you can get besides a sub to the perfect 1 and done watch. i'd recommend trying it on in person though. fully polished center links are quite a thing in person. pictures really don't do how shiny it is justice. definitely flashier than the submariner so that's kind of the opposite of what it sounds like you want. that said
3. nomos is by far the enthusiast pick here and zero risk of anyone trying to steal or think it's valuable. no one will look twice at it except other watch nerds. so totally different from your sub i think if you're actually interested in what that watch offers you will wear it a lot.
4. cartier is not exactly versatile design wise and a pretty bold design at that. i'd say you will probably end up just wearing your sub but obviously that's just a hunch.",2024-11-06 05:21:12

also, there is a chance it is a fake. 1970s was the prime time of the mass influx of hk-made oyster-style fakes to western markets. back then the authentication and original rolex catalogues were only available in very few locations and customers had to rely on their watch shop's or jeweler's expertise and decency which were not always top-notch.

pretty much any brand you've heard about makes perfectly decent quality watches and none of them is going to be meaningfully more functional than another.

if you want to buy a new watch, my advice is think about what your style is and find a couple of options that you like, and then maybe post them here and ask if there's anything you should be aware of about them or if there are any similar ones in x price range that you should consider.

datejusts are so versatile though that i'd just quit while you're ahead and save your money for when you need to get it serviced. it's one thing to go down a rabbit-hole and overspend as a hobby if you're a bit too into watches.

while i was getting the zenith, my daughter expressed interest in the pink longines also pictured above. i knew nothing of the brand, which i now feel embarrassed about, as i learned they are the oldest swiss watch maker with a rich history in accurate timekeeping.

Dry_Caregiver5034,datejust,"hi everyone,

this is my rolex datejust ref. 1603 circa 1979—the most important watch in my collection, as it was my father’s first watch and the one i saw him wear every day until he passed it down to me.

i’ve shared my collection before, and i’ve received some comments questioning the originality of this watch, specifically mentioning the cyclops. personally, i’ve looked at other pieces with the same reference and around the same production year, and they seem quite similar, but i’m not an expert. so, i’d really appreciate it if you could be more specific. i know my father firmly believes the watch is original—he bought it as such from a trusted jeweler in texas. thankfully, money was never an issue, and rolex was much more accessible back then.

that said, i think it’s worth mentioning that this watch was stolen from my father and later recovered, so i don’t know if any modifications were made during that time. for example, when he got it back, it was missing its original jubilee bracelet, so he had to replace it with this oyster bracelet. i’m also attaching some (very low-quality, sorry!) photos taken by a local watchmaker when i took it in for repair because the winding mechanism was broken. he didn’t mention anything unusual about the watch or its caliber 3035, so i hope these photos can serve as a reference.

regardless of whether it’s 100% original or not, it will always be the most important watch to me. as i mentioned before, it’s the watch i saw my father wear every day, making it one of the most meaningful gifts i’ve ever received. and honestly, it’s not about the money. in fact, i think the story of the theft just adds more charm and character to it. i simply enjoy knowing everything about my watches and their history.

i’ve also been considering finding the original jubilee bracelet for this model, so if anyone knows the exact reference or how to track one down, i’d really appreciate your help.

one more question—i haven’t seen many watches with broken lume (i think that’s what you call the white material inside the hands). what causes this?

i want to learn everything i can about this model.",2025-02-26 20:25:44

i put myself inline for a new datejust. i am curious to see if i do get a call. my purchases are spread between the hyde park in ca and co.

nice_things_i_like,gmt,"it has been a while since i last visited this subreddit. a recent research and purchase prompted me to revisit and i thought why not share something useless.

my first watch purchase was back in 2016. a year prior i became interested in watches when i saw the nomos tangente online.

like many people who get into watches it quickly spurred into buying and collecting many watches.

at one point i found many watches in my possession (up to nine at once), but only wore a couple at regular frequency. from owning and handling many different watches i come to realize what i actually liked and didn't like. also came to the realization that paying for maintenance on many watches i almost never wear is silly. this resulted in the eventual purging of the collection to only essentials.

by 2019 i've liquidated most of my watches and only kept one (rolex gmt batman). since then i rotated out one and added two more. i actually came out ahead in net financials given some of the watches i owned appreciated. for example, the batman i had sold more than double on the grey market. whatever i sold i put the money in the market as funds for retirement. but lets be honest it was also to buy watches in the future.

for nearly the last 4-5 years i was running with just two watches, but just recently added the omega.

a week later i get the call from the ad they had the datejust i was trying to source. drove out and saw the chocolate datejust sitting there unsold. mind you this was during covid and people weren't exactly shopping. i made the decision to buy the two datejusts, but also asked if they could work on the price given i was buying two watches :)

the omega fois is a recent purchase. i owned the first release of the fois, which i kept for a few years. i loved the smaller size, in particular the lack of crown guard and how it isn't like the professionals. but there were some things i disliked about it, which is no official metal band and no dome crystal.

over the years i did miss the watch, especially its manual winding action. it is much more satisfying than winding the rolex or grand seiko.

i was casually browsing on some watch news sites and stumbled upon the release of the second version of the fois. to me the changes they made hit it out of the park. the choice of fauxtina for the lume is a bit controversial, but it doesn't bother me as i see it as a color accent to the blue dial and not really faux patina. i understand the choice for case back, but i think the first version of the fois has a much better case back. regardless, i plan to replace the case back with a thinner sapphire window when spiralwinder releases one.

# looks like you own more than three watches?

yeah, i still have the hamilton khaki field watch. i keep it around since it is my first mechanical. i maybe wear it once a year. it has high sentimental value, but low $$ value.

i also have an apple watch ultra, but i use it for workouts only.

# watches i plan to purchase in the future

i honestly miss having the rolex gmt. when i owned the batman i made frequent use of the bezel and hour hand. i am eying the bruce wayne or the full rose gold variation. i have my name on the list for both at my local ad. i refuse to buy the bruce wayne at current grey market prices, but the full rose gold may make more sense with grey market. i also considered the root beer, but feel it would overlap too much with the current two tone datejust.

the only other watches i have in my sights are the [als 1815 up/down 234.032](https://www.alange-soehne.com/us-en/timepieces/1815/1815-updown/1815-updown-in-18-carat-pink-gold-234-032) and [als datograph up/down 405.031](https://www.alange-soehne.com/us-en/timepieces/saxonia/datograph-updown/datograph-updown-in-18-carat-pink-gold-405-031) (or maybe one of the other color ways). i wouldn't get both. both have been on my list for several years now. i plan to get either whenever i go into retirement, which is not anytime soon. i think they'll round out the collection nicely.",2025-01-11 04:47:43
nice_things_i_like,datejust,"it has been a while since i last visited this subreddit. a recent research and purchase prompted me to revisit and i thought why not share something useless.

my first watch purchase was back in 2016. a year prior i became interested in watches when i saw the nomos tangente online.

like many people who get into watches it quickly spurred into buying and collecting many watches.

at one point i found many watches in my possession (up to nine at once), but only wore a couple at regular frequency. from owning and handling many different watches i come to realize what i actually liked and didn't like. also came to the realization that paying for maintenance on many watches i almost never wear is silly. this resulted in the eventual purging of the collection to only essentials.

by 2019 i've liquidated most of my watches and only kept one (rolex gmt batman). since then i rotated out one and added two more. i actually came out ahead in net financials given some of the watches i owned appreciated. for example, the batman i had sold more than double on the grey market. whatever i sold i put the money in the market as funds for retirement. but lets be honest it was also to buy watches in the future.

for nearly the last 4-5 years i was running with just two watches, but just recently added the omega.

i always wanted a grand seiko with spring drive. i also wanted a visually ""lighter"" watch to wear during the warmer months that worked well with my seasonal outfits (basically aloha shirts and shorts). when the watch was was released i knew immediately this was it. the dial with its hint of pink added something unique to my collection, in addition to the watch being titanium. it reminded me of the snowflake, which was also a watch on my radar. i like how the sakura dial was almost like a different variation of the snowflake.

nice_things_i_like,datejust,"it has held up pretty well.

the case doesn’t show scratches on the matte parts, while the mirrored parts show some light micro ones. on the bracelet there are some minor micro scratches on some of the matte sections especially the clasp area, which i attribute from desk diving. the mirrored sections on the bracelet does show some light micro scratches, more so than the case.

overall it isn’t bad considering how long i’ve had the watch and what i put it through. i don’t exactly baby the watches, but i also try to be mindful where i swing my watch arm.

the amount of scratches on the gs is much less than the datejust. the mirrored sections on it are micro scratched galore, but it looks uniform at this point and not apparent unless looking closely.

i find the gs i own to have some depth in the gray metal and not particularly dull and flat.

the stainless on the datejust has comparable scratches to the gs.

the datejust ss brushed areas have little to no scratches. the few i do see are very light surface area ones and are only apparent depending how the light hits. the mirrored areas show what i would say the expected level of scratches.

on the gs there are more visible scratches on the brushed areas compared to the datejust. the density of scratches aren’t a lot, just a few random ones, but stand out more. so while the titanium does resist a lot of a scratches, there are few which sneak their way in, if that makes any sense.",2025-01-11 19:43:31

JSTORRobinhood,datejust,"i’m gunna be real with you… not sure how you reached the conclusion that a rolex felt the same as a longines because in my experience, rolexes are definitely sturdier and heftier. which isn’t to say that they’re worth the incredible price difference -  i don’t think they are and i have even cleared all the 6-digit references from my collection - but they are still very well-built and sturdy watches. maybe the modern choice of high-relief polish on a modern datejust makes it look like a cheap chrome watch but it definitely isn’t. but also at the end of the day, collect what makes you happy. if you aren’t wowed by rolex, buy something else. at the low five-digit range, you can start looking into beautiful vacherons and pateks on the secondary market for a dress piece and just keep wearing your tissots on the day-to-day. when i started buying rolexes, i was a basic corporate baby and everyone wore them. now i just wear a 40-year-old datejust or a casio calculator",2024-12-29 17:20:30
diyexageh,datejust,"well you say you collect watches, id o not know how long you have been collecting. but you have clearly reached the point where you can tell things apart.

rolex watches in general are not the epitome of luxury, though they are a marketing marvel. te watches themselves are quite ok, specially the modern ones post 2001 approx, you do get solid bracelets and very sharp finishing and polish. technically, the movements are nothing to be in awe for, they are good workhorses. but as you might have figured already, nothing other movements cannot do for less and probably at the same specs.

you might have also fallen a bit for all the social media frenzy and hype. luxury watches, or shall i say luxury in general has been normalized by social media so you would expect them to be this unattainable awesome things. then you handle them and can't wait to feel a bit underwhelmed about the whole thing.

i would say, that is good. now you can see past the hype and look for something better. walk into jaeger lecoultre and check a reverso, it is about 4000 usd less than the datejust. visit zenith, they have stuff for that range that will blow your socks. the chronomaster original triple date is 13.200 usd. the non-triple date version is 9.8k and you would still have 3k almost to buy a second hand tudor or a few of seikos xd.

there are better watches out there, rolex are good, they are also produced in the millions per year and mostly fake scarcity and hype makes them objects of desire.

rolexes are overvalued in the secondary market but calling them cheap is either trolling or just being severely misinformed.  i also don't get why you would compare longines to ""cheap"".

both longines and rolex are great.  rolex has better finishing, tolerances, materials, and movement technology.  but is a rolex 5x better than a longines?  in my humble opinion, no.

but even though everyone here loves to make fun of rolex ""fanboys"", there is no denying the fact that if you buy a gmt-master ii blro at msrp, you are basically gifted at least $7,000 (at the time of this writing).  compare that with the hydroconquest gmt where you lose half of its msrp value as soon as you walk out of the ad.",2024-12-30 01:47:41

i wore that rolly 24/7, working in the garden center and nursery business, in some rough environments. so, i got my money's worth out of it and it still looked great the whole time. if you switch between watches, as with a collection, the self-winding feature is no good. you'd be pulling on the crown and re-setting the watch every time you wanted to wear it. they just are not made for that amount of action. they are best being kept up by rolex but that expense soon exceeds the price of the watch. so, be advised.",2024-12-29 20:18:56

also (some) people buy rolex with the expectation that it will give them some sort of recognition or validation. the reality is almost nobody care what you wear unless they are watch people. having said that, as a brand rolex will certainly be recognised in the wild. iconic design which has barely changed in the past 60 years, fluted bezel and the sub-style watch with the magnified date window are pretty iconic and might, in certain circumstances, attract a subset of individuals. they might be of the opposite sex, goldiggers of any kind or the usual ""friend of other's personal property"".

lord_frost_,gmt,"in school, my grail was the g-shocks, but i never got one because they were expensive (for then-me).

in undergrad, i wanted the citizen eco-drive, but didn't get that one either since i thought my casio illuminator would be more robust.

at my first job, i wanted a bracelet watch, so went with an edifice and kept that till it broke a few years later, right before i joined my master's program. i was planning to replace it with another edifice, but then studies and whatnot came, so i put aside watches for a while.

after graduation and getting a job, i became close friends with one of my colleagues and he introduced me to his collection - alpinist, tissot prx, etc. which got me hooked on automatic watches.

he accompanied me while i went to get my first auto - hamilton khaki field titanium. that watch accompanied me through my unemployment phase and then i wore it to my first day at my new work as well.

to celebrate the new job, and a relocation, i wanted to get another watch. so i was planning on going for longines spirit zulu, since i felt a gmt would be cool!  
but then grand seiko caught my eye and i was looking at those for a while. i didn't get either because i was stocking up my emergency savings. once the savings were set aside, i found that these two watches didn't connect with me as much. i didn't feel like ""i need it!"", so i kept waiting.  
and then, on a date with my gf, we randomly went into an omega boutique, where they had the first omega in space speedmaster. instantly i knew i needed it. and so i got it!

i started with a lot of higher end stuff (jlc, omega, gs) and my tastes changed a lot during that time from high end dress pieces to high end tool watches etc. 

i really settled into a watch when i got an oris bcpd of all things my wife really loved it and so when we renewed our vows i wore that. over time it became my favorite watch. then i got a hamilton which i picked up on a whim because it was a good deal and i ended up wearing that a bunch too. long story short, i liquidated most of my higher end stuff because i was just getting more enjoyment out of the $1k-$2k range. i also found that i really love pilot and field watches. 

now i’m looking to slowly build out a collection of things i love without trying to chase pieces that other people think are great. i love my khaki field expeditoon even though others don’t like the compass bezel. i love my oris even with the 50m water resistance. do i wish i had things like otf adjustment and more power reserve, yes, but do i miss my speedy? not really. it was a great watch but i didn’t love it like i love my other watches and i used the extra funds to take the family on a trip where i made memories with a watch i love.

i can see picking up a neo-vintage iwc chronograph, maybe one of those new seamasters, but i really now prefer tool watches that look nice but not blingy. i can’t ever see a submariner in my collection for that reason. but i can absolutely see an iwc mark xx or better yet a spitfire. maybe a seiko sla079 too.",2024-12-03 14:29:24

SanderDieman,gmt,"dj fluted is a fairly narrow bezeled watch (as compared to eg a dive watch like a sub, or a functional tool watch like a gmt), yet that bezel is very glitzy.

what that means is that typically, smaller sizes look better:

however being a pilot i have a need for zulu time. i wore a citizen nighthawk in the military and actually used the e6-b to do fuel calculations before the fms was common in our aircraft. however nowadays i need reading glasses to see something that small. i don’t need glasses in the cockpit but i carry them for reading small things. and on the nighthawk the gmt hand is very small. 

for a pilot watch i want simplicity. never in my life have i used a tachymeter. even in the days of times approaches we just watched the second hand.

another feature that i would have found useful is the gmt, because weather updates at airfields and along routes are all issued in zulu time, otherwise known as global mean time (gmt). so, tuning the radio into the information frequency of an airfield, hearing the update was at “oh-two-fifty-five-zulu” (for example), a gmt hand on the watch would tell me immediately how current that update was.

tbh, the zulutime beats the gmt master in terms of legibility and logically it makes more sense to own as it’s less flashy and more affordable but nevertheless, it was the one i had to let go. ever since i started my flight training, i was sold to the idea and romance that the gmt master is “the watch” worn by pilots. the heart wants what the hearts  wants as they say, so i kept the 16710 and it has been my daily ever since. i love the idea of one day having the aluminum bezel fade on me thinking of how many flight hours i’ve gained alongside it. 😎

i wanted a rotating bezel so i can have gmt permanently on the gmt hand and then use the bezel for local time in a slip port. the explorer style doesn’t do this so off the list. i made myself a couple of aliexpress clones with a seiko nh34 in the gmt ii and explorer style to see how they wear etc. i came to the conclusion that the cyclops magnifier for the date was more of a hinderance than a help as it distorted the hands of the watch.

i started looking for alternatives and looked at the grand seiko gmt sbge277 with spring drive. finish of the face and body of the watch is much better than the rolex, though the bracelet is not as refined. the face is also a little ‘busier’ than the rolex. big advantage was that i tried one one on, i liked it and was able to buy t on the spot. initially i thought i might use this watch until the rolex became available, but now i think i prefer it to the rolex and will use the money saved to purchase another grand seiko spring drive dress watch.

when i think of pilot watches i think of the ones that still retain some of the heritage to the original pilot watches. so out of these i'd pick only the sinn, rolex air king, and iwc. the others are too busy or lack the heritage, and the speedmaster is practically just pilot watch themed with the ""artificial horizon"". i get that some of these may have features useful for pilots or designed with pilots in mind but they're too far from the traditional style for me.

my first watches were departmet store fare back in the 80's.  also a timex ironman trialthlon.  a buddy and i had the same ironman and i remember us playing a game where we tried to start and stop the chronograph function as fast as possible, striving for that elusive ""0.01"" readout.

my first ""nice"" watch was a two-tone seiko kinetic...my ex and i bought matching ones.  i think they totaled about $500 back in 1997 or so.  i ended up with several seikos - mostly kinetics and a few titanium models.  i thought seikos were pretty neat.

fast-forward to 2006, and my manager was into watches.  he was the first guy i had ever met that was into watches.  he had a couple of tudors and i can't remember what else.  i remember he had a white-faced tudor with ""tiger"" printed in red script i thought it was pretty cool although i could have done without the ""tiger"" on it as i didn't play golf.  funny enough i can't find a pic of it anywhere...i see pics of the prince but i don't remeber my manager's watch being a chronograph.  anyway, i decided to take the plunge into really nice watches and so i went 'round to my local high-pressure-sales jewelry store and bought a couple of tags - a cream-dialed link chronometer and a white-dialed f1.

i continued my tag collecting with a couple of carrera chronos, an aquaracer, another f1 (black dial).  i also branched out and bought a hamilton jazzmaster chrono, a hamilton pan-europ, more seikos, and a smattering of other pieces.  including several g-shocks at one point.

along the way, i became aware of rolex.  i mean, i knew of rolex, but rolex to me had always meant datejust.  i didn't even know rolex had a ""sport"" line.  when i started checking them out i became smitten with the polar.  and i have been ever since.

as i started taking note of what other folks were wearing, i noticed that if they were wearing a rolex sport watch it was always a black sub.  and i mean always.  this made me want the polar even more.  nobody had one!  nobody even seemed to have the black explorer ii.

but alas, the price!  with the money i had tied up in (mostly) tags, i couldn't see also shelling out for the polar, and for some reason i wasn't comfortable with selling my entire collection to afford it.  this truly puzzles me; i don't know if it was fear of the trying to sell my collection (getting ripped off by shady buyers, etc), or the distaste of the prospect of losing a bunch of money after having bought all my watches new, or both, or what.  whatever it was, i didn't end up making any sort of plan to buy the polar.

what i did do is try to substitute this watch or that watch for the rolex.  i had an alpha and an invicta that resembled the polar, and i even went so far as to purchase a debaufre gmt ocean-2, which was a dead ringer.  but i rarely wore any of them, because i literally felt ashamed and like a big faker.

eventually i sold most of my watches (most of my rifles too) because i needed the money for actual life things.  let's say i was motivated, and so found a way to get over any mental blocks i had vis-a-vis selling watches on the bay.  i kept the tag f1's and the hamiltons and the g-shocks.  (and my marlin 1895 45-70.)  my favorite was a toss-up between that white-dialed f1 and the hamilton chrono.

but then i sort of fell out of watches.  partly because of my increasing work-from-home schedule, and partly because i bought an apple watch.  i bought it mainly for road biking, but i felt compelled to wear it all the time due to the sleep monitoring and all that.  it left no room for other watches, unless i was willing to dual-wield, which i was not.  i'm no nicholas hayek.

so what's all this got to do with the watch in the pic?  well, i eventually came back around.  i was still 100% wfh, but i decided owning and wearing cool watches made me feel good, so i decided to take it all back up.",2025-03-26 18:31:17
ymlmkb,datejust,"so i got my grail watch...now what?

i have been wanting a polar explorer ii for as long as i have been into watches - 20 years or so.  but i couldn't bring myself to buy one because of the cost.  ironic, because i've certainly spent the 2005 cost of the watch over the course of my watch journey.  but it is what it is.

ymlmkb,gmt,"the sotc was grim.  the white-dialed f1 had damage to the crown guards.  the black-dialed one wouldn't run, despite a battery change.  half of the g-shocks were dead.  the only watch i got any joy out of wearing was the hamilton chrono, and it was illegible.  not that it had become that way suddenly or anything...it had always been.  silver hands, with no lume, on a silver dial don't make the most readabile of watches.  beautiful, but kinda hard on the eyes.  so i decided to sell it all...



...and buy a grand seiko mist flake.



dumb.



i thought the mist flake would scratch the polar itch, and i had always loved spring drive, so i thought ""why not?"".



dumb.  everybody says ""hold out for the one you want"".  i'm here to say that this advice is sound.



i even went so far as to make up things in my mind as to why i didn't want or need to rolex.  ""i simply will not spend that kind of money on a watch - any watch.""  ""i refuse to play the ad game.""  ""i don't want to be a 'rolex guy'.""  ""rolexes give off a certain vibe and it's not one i want.""



yeah, it was all bs head games.  after a couple months of owning the mist flake i still wanted the polar explorer ii just as bad as i ever did.  it all came to a head last saturday, when teddy dropped a video called ""why this rolex still impresses me after 6 years of ownership"".  i honestly didn't know what watch he'd be talking about (i didn't notice the damn thing in the thumbnail), so when he started talking about his polar i just kind of sat there with my jaw hanging open for a second.  no, really.  i thought it was some kind of sign.



so discussed it with my wife, who simply said ""i don't see why you don't just buy the thing you want.""  or exasperated words to that effect :-)



3 days later, i had the watch.  bought it from bob's.  it is a nice box-and-papers piece from 1996.  i did some research and decided i liked the generation that was current when i first got into ""serious"" watches.  and like teddy, i wanted one with the lug holes.  i felt the 2 subsequent redesigns had given the watch a more luxurios air that was slightly off-putting, particularly the rolex branding around the rehaut.  also, i have small-ish wrists.



so what now?  i have wanted this watch for so long, that having it feels...weird.  i guess i am surprised that it just feels like another watch.  i mean i love it and everything, but i guess i was expecting angels to sing or something.



shortly after i bought the mist flake i half-heartedly started an ""all-seiko"" collection.  i bought a couple of solar chronos (ssc947 and ssc911) and a couple other gmts (ssk033 and ssk019). i think i'll keep the 911 and the 033 for variety.  and of course, the mist flake.  of my ""really nice"" watches, i consider the mist flake to be the ""dressy gmt"" and the polar to be the ""everyday gmt"".

secondly, yes this is a great collection. you got a chrono and a dive watch, 2 of the most iconic kinds of watches. and the dress watch for more formal occassions fits in really nicely too.

i think the snoopy and the submariner are great. however, if i am being honest, the cartier does not match up. i would recommend upgrading it in the future to get a jlc reverso or a grand seiko dress watch.",2024-09-19 05:02:03

IAmAHorseSizedDuck,gmt,"take note that there are 2 different types of gmts.. the true/flyer gmt and the office/caller gmt... the way you set it will be different. you're already familiar with your watch, which is a true/flyer.. the office/caller moves the gmt hand in the second crown position and has a quickset date.

if you're travelling a lot and want a gmt, i'd recommend the true/flyer variant. these tend to be more expensive. for cheaper options, look for watches with a miyota 9075 movement. avoid the seiko nh34 and sellita 330 as they are both office/caller.

for watches with in house movements, longines spirit zulu time or tudor bb58 gmt are both 39mm. or you could just get her another gmt master :p

there seem to be some genuine parts, like the case, crown, and bezel insert, but at best this watch is frankensteined together.

it could be 12mm thick, chunky but decent, but domed crystal puts it at a **thick 14.6**.

since diver isn't as much of a complication as it used to be, wr is common, slap on dive bezel and we're good to go.

gmt is a nice complication that can be done in many ways that enhances the design. but looking at the most common one, why the fuck would i ever need 3 timezones that a rotating bezel gives? sure, there probably exist dussins of bussinessmen in the us that make calls from their office to different timezones, so make a dresswatch with gmt hand and rotating bezel for those guys. it doesn't need to be the go-to gmt design. 

gmt means travel, travel means gada, so make it a diver-gmt! lorier does that, a very nice design that combines gmt and diver legacy while still looking modern, but sadly puts it into what sums up to a fat one. if they are reading this and considering launching another version, pls slim it down to the 39mm while we're at it.

i don't care for the power reserve indicator on the pictured gs.

they should be restocking in about a month. the one downside is the inner rotating 24 hour bezel is a touch hard to read at times but perhaps that's just the white on gray color way i got. it's also somewhat finicky to adjust with the second screw down grown but it gives the watch a unique aesthetic.",2024-08-31 14:16:24

the bulgari is the most expensive watch i own, but it feels totally worth it just from a technical perspective. the way the rotor surrounds the entire movement, the way the two halves of the case are put together, and the fact that they've fitted a chronograph, gmt and exhibition case back into something so thin is crazy. plus the design is so well executed - angles and circles, super comfy bracelet, the way the pushers blend into the case, it really is such an underrated watch imho.

this is one of the first ones ever made, back when no one wanted them. if history repeats its self like it does for a lot of vintage rolex’s, these will be the ones to collect, the very early models. if you look closely you will notice that the dial lettering is slightly different than the on the newer ones. the “submariner” isn’t bold, the color of the bezel is a bit more matte, the inner clasp is sandblasted not polished, the engraving on the rehault is done differently, and the ft= text on the dial is different.

spctr13,submariner,"right, and on most dive watches above $1k if you rotate the bezel so that the triangle sits above 12 the triangle on the bezel will perfectly align with the indice on the dial. further, on most dive watches in the sub's price range, as you rotate the bezel every other click (for a 120 click bezel, 60 clock will be every click) will perfectly align with the minute on the chapter ring. on many submariners, rolex fucks this up such that the bezel triangle does not fall in line with the indices. 

when criticized, rolex has always responded saying it's due to their manufacturing process on the ceramic subs. apparently they mount the bezel insert into the bezel before mounting the bezel on the watch case because of how brittle and fragile the ceramic bezel is. whenever a rolex representative answers this they try to play it down like it isn't a problem or that the triangle isn't supposed to perfectly align anyway since it doesn't affect the bezels function which is bullshit. rolex didn't ever have an issue with the pre-ceramic subs, and if they had, i doubt they'd have gotten as popular as they are today.

if you make a warranty claim on the submariner for this issue they'll fix it, but i think most will agree with me this is unacceptable for the price of a rolex. especially since omega, at roughly half the price, and oris, at about 1/5 the price, both use ceramic bezels and do not have this issue. there's always going to be things like this that skip through the cracks, but about 30-40% of ceramic submariners i've seen in person have had this issue. interestingly, tudor also exhibits this problem on the black bay. when i went to my local ad and pointed it out on the sub and black bay they had there the salesman just played it off like it wasn't a big deal until i showed him the omegas on display all lined up as did the grand seikos he had.",2018-06-14 10:18:38

Hrmnsn,submariner,"took my trusty old tudor submariner to a party this saturday and happened to meet up with a friend who just bought a rolex submariner.

i snapped a quick picture to compare them, and figured r/watches might like to see.

my tudor is a reference 79190, the last of the breed. it's the only full size tudor submariner with a sapphire crystal. it dates back to about 1996.

the rolex is a reference 116610lv, also known as the hulk. it's quite possibly the most popular rolex submariner on the market today.

for those who might not know tudor is fully owned by rolex and the submariners featured all rolex parts, except for the movement.

the hulk has the tudor beat on pretty much all bases. it's more glamorous with it's white gold indexes, it has a much more solid link bracelet, it's water resistance is up from 200 to 300 meters. it's got a cermaic bezel and the engraved chapter ring.the glide-lock clasp is also a fantastic piece of kit i'd love to have.  it's also a lot more expensive, with prices going through the roof lately.

however i still feel the tudor holds its ground with its more rugged tool-watch no-nonsense dial. i also personally prefer the thinner lugs and crown guards of the pre maxi-case submariner. 

that being said, the hulk is an awesome watch and i fully understand why it's so popular.",2018-04-09 21:33:27
Cybalist,submariner,"> tudor is fully owned by rolex and the submariners featured all rolex parts, except for the movement.

the tudor in the picture even has a rolex logo on the crown.

the fact that it's the same parts bin with the same foundation behind both brands makes it more legitimate than other brands just copying the design in my opinion.

that being said, i'm sure the majority of people will think it's a homage or even a fake rolex.

unfortunately, the lady told me the waitlist for the ""hulk"" was 2+ years long; the piece in the vault was for the next client on the waitlist. i called everywhere in a 100-mile radius for a week only to get extremely lucky; a local watch collector received a mint ""hulk"" as a trade and was selling for shortly above retail. i immediately jumped at the opportunity and came running home to post to this subreddit. thanks for looking!",2018-03-27 23:45:20

bboy7,submariner,"yes, and plenty rich people go shopping in ferraris.

electronic watches can withstand low temperatures just as fine. casio g-lide watches are superior low temperature tools. you want big buttons that can be operated with gloves on? how about a $100 g9000, or virtually any other equivalent? for serious climbing, a rolex doesn't perform any better than an skx. all the watches i listed so far are iso tested. my skx013 is.

by all standards relevant to tools, rolex does not stand up to the competition. the simple fact that a submariner can not be easily procured, replaced and/or repaired makes it inferior to something as humble as a rangeman.

whether an insignificant number of submariners are worn by upper class divers makes no difference as to the objective superiority of digital watches worn by millions of blue collar workers. an f-91w is superior to an explorer when you're in the army on account of the simple fact that it won't get stolen from you. 

us navy seals switched from rolex to ironman/g-shock in the 80s. they get issued suuntos these days. chris kyle talks about his g-shock in his book. astronauts aboard the iss use dw-5600s. 

but sure, you can use a rolex as a tool, if you're into scuba diving and you like using an overpriced, technologically inferior product to accomplish what an infinitely more replaceable and serviceable tool can do.

ps: go find a mechanical watch that can do as much as my g-shock can. i challenge you.",2018-02-17 17:22:22
bboy7,submariner,"this doesn't change the fact that a cheap seiko can go toe to toe with an explorer in cold environments, and is vastly more accessible and serviceable. wanna guess which manufacturer makes a watch that is many times cheaper than a submariner and has a higher depth rating and a sturdier construction? if your watch runs 20 seconds late within the span of a single dive, you've got a malfunctioning watch. the skx will not run 20 seconds late. neither a sub or an skx should run 2 seconds late in that time, unless they are broken. incidentally, a quartz tuna will run better than either. 

what i'm saying is that there are many watches which will get the job done better, in most instances bar a few extremely specific ones in which you are still better off with something sold by a competitor at a much lower price despite equivalent or superior standards of quality. from the point of view of a tool user, rolex watches are simply outdated and impractical. can they be used as tools? sure. but for the most they aren't marketed as such, they aren't sold as such, they aren't worn as such. anyone who chooses rolex as a tool is making multiple compromises in the name of using a rolex.

i don't want to come across as a rolex basher: i adore the explorer, and any black ceramic sub makes me drool. i think they are beautiful, extremely high-quality watches. but i'm a layman, and an ex-army grunt, and a 100€ digital quartz watch packs an insane amount of value for anybody whose main concern is practicality.

i’m also keen to ‘touch and feel’ the sea-dweller, having not had one on my wrist i’m unsure of the feel but i love the idea of having something a little bit more unique than a black sub (hence the appeal of the greenness of the hulk!).

its the unusual look that sets the hulk apart for me and the complication of the gmt ii & panerai that draws me to them.  i feel (based on nothing more than my gut) that the batman will maintain its appeal and that the hulk could be the riskier choice.  that said, my intention is to keep it and pass it on, so i should try to keep this out of my think.

bungsana,gmt,"my opinions on watches veer a bit differently than most on this subreddit but... i honestly think the whole ""pass it on"" thing is a joke.  by the time my kid(s) grow up and are responsible enough to get an expensive watch from me, they either will hate it (fashion and style will have changed for the most part), or it will be technologically outdated (already is, but even more so at that juncture) or they won't like wearing watches.  case in point, look at vintage watches in the past.  with the exception of a few watches, most '50s-70's watches are not popular.


so, in summary, yes if you buy a popular high profile watch now, especially in a more mainstream configuration, your offspring may really like the watch when you give it to them.  however, there is a high likelihood that they will not treasure it as much as you do.  you cannot place what you perceive as value into the watch, onto them (they will value it much less, with only a few emotional ties attached to it).  just buy the watch that you enjoy, wear the shit out of it so that they kids see you with it on, and that will create more ""worth"" than anything to them.

a little back story on this and rolex. when i got into collecting i actually never cared for rolex watches. i've always seen them as the watch everyone thinks they have to have to be noticed. the only ones at that time i truly cared for and still would like to have one day were the skydwellers. until i was doing some shopping in a second hand watch district in doha, qatar and stumbled across this model. i had never seen this watch up until then and green has always been one of those colors i truly love and it just stuck to me. i couldn't shake the rolex bug after seeing this watch. as you can see i eventually tracked one down from davidsw out of florida who gave me a great deal with a watch that was essentially brand new, the watch had one owner and was only 1-2 months old when i picked it up. so new that all the plastic was still on it and i got to enjoy peeling them off. i've owned this watch right at about a year now and still love wearing it. i have also researched more and more into the company and fallen in love with several other pieces along the way but have yet to pull the trigger on any others as of yet.

metal_fever,submariner,"a bit of warning: ads advise against resizing the bracelet yourself because they heat the bracelet to soften up the glue so there is no risk of the screw breaking.

also make sure the screws are in tight again, back when rolex submariners became popular with divers there was a place that was popular to look for lost submariners due to the screw pins getting loose.

Feezbull,gmt,"i would ditch the idea of any of those rolexes honestly unless you truly love the look. why? overpriced. crazy hoops and quests to fulfil as well as lifelong missions before maybe getting one. they also make 1m pieces of the brand yearly in mass production but still get treated like they're something so special...

that said.... the vc is hands down a better watch in general but of course, they're costlier. 

if you dream of one as you said, then maybe it's best to save for it and eventually get one (56 collection, patrimony, traditionelle, heritage etc) rather than 'settle' for something else and still covet that vc anyway and end up paying 8-14k more in total as you'd have spent that initial budget on an other watch.

unless you're planning on getting a few more watches anyway, i would wait longer and get the vc if it were me because it's better to spend a bit more and take a longer time than to spend less, settle and still end up spending a lot more anyway as you're always wondering 'man, what if, ah i should have waited for that' and be unhappy with the second choice.

that said, the jlc is a good watch for sure. check out the vc and jlc on the used/secondhand market as their prices drop a fair bit and you can get very good condition/new ones even at a cost that's far more palatable than brand new from a boutique or even authorised dealer. 

if you still want those rolexes, be prepared to have health potions, perform crazy quests, offer them to rent your cat for free, serve them on a gold platter and wait 1-2 years and maybe you can get the sumba/gmt/explorer that all look similar anyway and is nothing as well done/made/finished as the jlc or vc you're considering.",2023-09-22 07:24:58

think about datejusts by themselves for a second.  there are 4 different types of datejusts configurations across 3 different sizes (just leaving it to men for now.) by my count, there are 17 different dials produced. 

even though 800k - 1m seems like a lot, when you account for the several different combinations of their most basic (and highest selling) watch, along with the fact that somewhere between one-third to half of the watches produced are women’s models, that number gets a heck of a lot smaller. the universe of buyers is pretty large, especially when we account for the rise of wealth and subsequent demand across asia. 

there are less sports models available because there are less of them made. full stop. with an increase to the number of people wanting those specific models, it makes it very easy to see how supply and demand would create a premium on the secondary market. that premium has gone down as of late, but as has demand with less people being equity and crypto rich trying to enter the market.

CrocodileJock,gmt,"i've been checking out gmt's myself recently. i'm going to give another vote for the christopher ward. great looking watch. for some reason, i'd dismissed christopher ward as a brand i wasn't keen on – but this watch single-handedly made me look at the brand afresh, and it's definitely on my list.

i'm also going to throw a couple from **bell & ross** into the mix.

if you like the iconic b&r rounded square case – the **br05g-bl-st/sst** is a real statement piece.

if  you're tastes are more for the 'classic' – they also have one in their 'vintage' range – the **br v2-93 gmt**. out of the two, i'm not sure which one i'd go for to be honest! both are towards the top end of your budget.

another watch i've looked at, while not a gmt,  has some of that functionality is the **wolbrook skindiver worldtimer**. vintage looks, and the worldtimer bezel approzimates some of the gmt function – albeit not that brilliantly. looks good though, and very affordable.

if the looks of that wolbrook watch floats your boat, but your really set on the gmt function, here's one last suggestion – and this is probably the one that is top of my list. the **citizen promaster worldtime gmt bj7100-82e.** super affordable, looks fantastic, tough as nails, eco-drive solar quartz (don't know how you feel about quartz – i'm a fan, in the right watch).",2022-08-01 10:52:31

Zamboni4201,gmt,"i wanted a rolex gmt master ii.  i put my name on my
local ad’s list for the rolex.  3-5 years.  they had a used one, just back from service for $19,500.  but, i’m not going to pay stupid secondary prices.  

the ad had a tudor.  i had seen it before, but this time i had them pull it out of the case.  they also had the demo (not for sale) gmt master.  the tudor is a bit more…subdued.  the matte bezel, the difference in the bracelet.  i’d read up on the tudor in-house movement already.  

i had ruled out the gs spring drive already.  if i’m getting a gs, i’m getting a titanium diver.  

i went home and read up on the longines spirit zulu. 
couldn’t find a longines ad with one in stock to even look at.  and, if i’m getting a longines. i’ll probably get their bigeye chrono,  
the seiko sharp edge, as beautiful as the dial is, it’s just too busy for me.  
and mido ad’s are apparently not very common.  

i waited a few weeks, and bought the tudor.  i think it’s because if i’d bought anything else, i’d have wished i’d gotten the tudor.  

wore the bracelet for awhile, and then switched to an erika’s original marine nationale strap after that, and it’s even better. 
i have been looking for a leather strap with a deployant clasp, but i’m not in a hurry.  i’m fussy about leather.  

as for your comment on eta, that’s probably incorrect.  the mido is a true gmt,  longines is also.  both are derived from eta movements because they’re all part of the swatch group.  
just about anything from a swatch family brand over $1000 will be an eta derived movement, and a true gmt.

pwsmoketrail,gmt,"u/vxheous has described the more common usage, but i do something different, and i'll explain why a travelers gmt operates the way it does.

i set the watch's gmt hand to, surprise, utc/zulu/gmt time. this ""universal"" time is the same worldwide and doesn't change.  the most useful watches to me have both an inner 24 hour scale as well as an outer 24 hour rotating bezel. this allows you to track a third time zone with the bezel if you wish, no math required.

the ""quick jump"" hour hand is actuated by a crown function usually and allows you to move the 12-hour hand in 1-hour increments *without stopping the watch*.  (many watches though using eta gmt movements have a gmt hand jumping crown, which is stupid.)

i have a couple of reasons for setting my gmt hand to actual gmt.  as both an airline pilot and private aircraft owner i fly a lot and everything aviation related is utc/zulu time.  second, if you go somewhere across the globe, having utc at a glance makes it easy to set the correct local time without needing to ask, see a clock, phone, or do the math of adding or subtracting your home/set time to get to utc time, then adding or subtracting that to get to local etc. you just need a little timezone map that shows utc+/-x where you are, glance at gmt hand and jump the hour + or - from the gmt hand.  if you don't have that for some reason, just take your longitude divided by 15, rounded to the nearest whole and *add* that number for east or *subtract* for west to get local time (might be off by one because of political borders etc).",2022-08-01 12:12:50
Vxheous,gmt,"in traveller (true) gmts, your main hour hand can ""jump"" forwards and backwards in 1 hour increments  while the gmt hand stays put (usually set to your home timezone). the bezel can be further rotated to track a third timezone, but it then you have to do the math to re-account for your home timezone.",2022-08-01 03:53:34

Sergeant_walrus222,gmt,how do you feel the tudor gmt stacks up against this overall quality-wise? debating between the two for my next addition and handling both the main difference i saw was in the luster of the steel (904l vs any 316l watch). but the remainder of the appearance / bezel + movement action / etc. seemed on par… wondering if any observation from someone who owned / owns both at some point,2021-06-14 17:46:39
ivemadeahugemissteak,gmt,"it’s the gmt hand - that hand completely rotates in 24 hours. at most for rolex gmt master watches, you can keep track of three time zones simultaneously - the normal hour hand and minute hand, the gmt hand with the minute hand, and then the rotating bezel with the gmt hand and minute hand.",2021-06-14 04:36:25
ivemadeahugemissteak,gmt,"i think the tudor is more utilitarian than the rolex gmt in that the tudor gmt bezel has 48 clicks compared to my batman’s 24 clicks. the tudor can track timezones in 30min increments. the tudor also has a jumping hour so it’s considered a “true gmt” so the movement inside is great. 

i really liked the watch as it had such a rugged look, but due to having a smaller wrist (6.5in) eventually the thickness got to me. the tudor gmt has a slab like design on the non crown side while the gmt batman does not. the other thing to note is the weight, it comes off as too heavy for me as the bracelet is not long (small wrist) and so i felt the watch in my day to day. the tudor pelagos is thicker but you don’t notice it due to the titanium design so it’s lightweight for its heft. the tudor gmt is the heaviest spec wise compared to the tudor pelagos and gmt batman. 

finally, one nitpick is compared to my bb58 navy, the hour plots is smaller in the tudor gmt compared to the bb58 which i found strange considering the gmt is 41mm compared the a bb58 39mm. this design also carried over to their newly released chronographs. i get that divers should be more legible, but the hour plots should be proportional to the size of the case. 

hope that helps. i normally delve into as much nuance as i can with every watch purchase as i tend to keep them, but eventually these notpicky details eventually got to me. if tudor rereleases the gmt in a thinner case and accommodates all the details i found as i owned it, i would purchase it again. but i doubt it as that will cannibalize their existing gmt stock. 

hope that helps.",2021-06-14 18:35:55

F15E_WSO,gmt,"recently got the blnr to join the two-tone. i have two sons, so needed two watches to hand down one day. i visited the ads in my local area back in early jan, also reached back to ad who sold me the two-tone, also a dealer in another city who is friend of a friend; ads in 3 cities (las vegas, houston, dfw). explained what and why i was looking for a second gmt, how it had to be the blnr and i was willing to wait....time was not an issue. in fact, told them if the watch went back to an oyster, that would be fine by me. checked in periodically with the ads and got a call in about 70 days\*.totally happy with the jubilee on the blnr (had doubts before the buy), way cool look, excellent feel. the movement in the blnr is def more accurate than the tt and also the reserve is all they say. early when the blnr came out in jubilee lots of jabs at rolex on the choice but i have no complaints. still don't have a difinitive answer on why rolex put it on a jubilee?  
  
i've been wearing the shit out of the blnr, watch is only about 3 months old now, it is a fantastic timepiece. i have about 20 watches of varying cost and quality; i have two vostoks, some casios, all price points, my point is these rolexes far exceed the quality and build of anything else--no surprise at the cost right? if you are a watch nerd and ""wonder"" is it worth the price.....i will tell you yes. it is worth the price. if you think this brand may be for you, then save your money, make it happen. you won't regret it.  
  
\*ad was totally clear on rolex's frustration with re-sales--pisses them off. hey, what market will bear..... right? but i think my reason for wanting the blnr and my story (convincing because based in truth) may have got me a bump in the call list. imho the dealers can see through the bs stories from folks wanting to double their money (not insignificant sum) and they will never get the call...... i love on r/watchexchange the folks who say ""yeah, bought this the other day, think it is not for me really, don't like the look, only worn once, wts $18k...."" uhh-huh",2021-05-21 17:10:47

a watch purchase should never have to be justified. there's nothing wrong with spending big money on an interest or hobby, but it should not reduce your ability to pursue other financial priorities.

to answer your questions:

1. does the high wear off? yes, like immediately. that's how all purchases go. the watches remain cool and desirable if you bought the right ones, but that rush passes quickly.

2. do i wish i spent more or less? my first ""luxury"" watch was a rolex submariner, back when they were like a third of the current price. it was incredibly disappointing, so i sold it immediately. i then bought a datejust, which was also disappointing and sold immediately. i then bought a jlc sector dial, which is breathtakingly perfect. the price is irrelevant because it was perfect for me, and i can't imagine ever physically or spiritually replacing it in my collection.

3. get the watch you want or a watch that holds value? get the watch you want every time. worry about value of stocks, bonds, or other boring shit. have fun with watches.

4. if you think there's a watch you want, then sit on the idea for a while. give it several weeks, maybe a few months. get off the forums and instagram. if you still want the watch after a few months, then the want is probably real. my personal advice is to collect like you're the only person on the proverbial desert island. buy only what you want, not what others say is desirable.",2021-05-07 22:47:51

i also wonder about the ultimate fate of the 149j1. if they never do another run, those could retain or gain value. for the most part they seem to at least be holding their market share.

Dopey1kanobi,gmt,"two years thinking about this watch. i first saw it when i stumbled upon john mayer’s episode of hodinkee’s talking watches where he referred to it as the “rolex voodoo.” i was smitten. 

i never thought i would own a rolex. the stigma over the 80’s and 90’s with the all-gold “fuck you” presidential rolex. i kind of had this thought that it’s the watch you buy when you made it in your career, and know nothing about watches. 
i told all my watch buddies over the years that i’d never get one. they all said i would succumb at some point, and i did. 

the more i read and researched, the more i became intrigued. i looked at some subs, but the one thing i was missing from my collection was a gmt and the blnr was one that i couldn’t get out of my head. 

i had a chance to buy one from an ad two years ago. i went home to sleep on it and called them the next morning, and it was gone. not long after that they had gotten the jubilee “batgirl” but i absolutely loved the look of the oyster bracelet. 

as i continued to call ad’s about it, i was always being told it was discontinued and they had none. that’s when i started to look at the gray market and some online watch auctions. couldn’t believe how pricey they’d become. 

starting in april of this year, i noticed watches were being dumped due to covid and this was about as good of a price point i’d get on this. pulled the trigger and i absolutely love it. the key little feature i love is the half link adjustment that you can make it slightly larger or smaller depending on wrist swell.",2020-05-15 01:42:54

kinger282,gmt,"i was ""lucky enough"" to have the opportunity to pick up a 12670blnr gmt. what i mean by ""lucky enough"" is there's an artificial shortage (in my eyes) of stainless steel rolex's at the moment. it's near impossible to pick up a batman, hulk, stainless daytona, and others of the sort from an ad. if you do want one right now, you can buy a used one or go grey market - but you'll pay 100%+ over msrp for some of these models. personally, i would never buy these models grey market, and i don't plan on flipping this piece to make a quick buck. i attribute each watch i own to an achievement in life, so they are all sentimental. if they happen to turn out to be great investments, then that's just a bonus and gives me peace of mind. there is a great debate on the investment proposition of watches though - personally, i think vintage watches are where the greatest value is for the future. buying modern rolex and expecting returns is all artificial (at this moment). the watches that will skyrocket in value and be worth 1000% its original value are the models that no one paid attention to.

so, with some luck at my local ad, i eventually got a hold of the batman. i went in just to look around and chat and they pulled this watch out of the back. i was overly ecstatic, because up until that moment i thought i'd never obtain this piece. i'm a huge watch nerd, and just seeing a batman in the flesh my mind acts like a school girl at a justin bieber concert.

don't be fooled, they didn't just pull this out of the back for no reason. i built up a relationship at the local ad by buying some watches, and it seems that's how you can obtain stainless steel models these days. rolex has built a 'pay to play' system, and i dislike it very much. essentially you have to purchase precious metal rolex watches, then you get priority for stainless steel watches. its a very selfish business model. for some interesting insight, here's an article on it:  [https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/us-steel-watch-shortage-good-for-gold](https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/us-steel-watch-shortage-good-for-gold)but don't get me wrong, i've seen many people get their hands on stainless watches from an ad without this kind of relationship. that's luck, timing, and talking. from my understanding, and what ads have told me, rolex ads get shipments of watches every 2 to 6 months, and they don't really have a say in what shows up. there are watches that rolex allows ads to special order, then there are others that they have no say. stainless models they cannot special order.

the gmt is one of my favourite movements rolex has to offer. setting the date, time, and gmt hand is a puzzle by itself, but having those functions are handy if you travel. luckily the new power reserve on this gmt is 70+ hours, so i don't have to reset the watch often. if you're a travelling person, this watch is for you. i recall seeing vintage ads of pilots wearing gmts on flights.

anyways, there's my 500 characters, i hope you can appreciate this piece of mechanical art as much as i do!",2019-08-30 12:56:50

blackmig,gmt,"hello all, 

i have been some time thinking in posting this, and using my holidays i got a picture i used as example.

i am sure some people will appreciate knowing this with an example...so:

if you have a gmt watch, in the north hemisphere, you can use it as a compass, as long as the gmt time is the same as the local. once that is done, whenever you want to know where the north is, you can point your hours to the sun, then look for the gmt hour and that’s the north.

in my picture:
- the gmt was not allocated to europe, that’s why i draw the hand if it was local, so it is clear as a reference.
- the black shadow under my hand is coming from a walking stick, that’s what i used to align the hour hand towards the sun. 
- the sun was very close to south at that time.

as other examples, imagine that 6am to 6pm is the sun visible. 
- 6am is east, and at that time the angle between hour and gmt would be around 90 degrees to the left (to 6am). that would say north is at your left when facing the sun with hour hands.
- 6pm is west,and at that time the angle between gmt and the hour hand will be 90 degrees to the right (to 18). that will say north is to your right when facing the hour hand to the sun. 

thinking about other examples, when you are very much north and the time sun is up almost full day i am thinking how to tackle it, to be honest. i will update once i find anything, or please add comment about it!!

and i loved to use the batman over mountains to be honest, blue over green is great!! :)

furthermore, my wedding is coming up and my fiancée got a rolex 31mm datejust mother of pearl set with diamonds from my parents. this scratched my itch further and i intensified my search and decided that i wanted the jlc mut moon. it’s the perfect dress watch. it has a moon phase, perfect symmetry, with a not too busy dial. jlc also has a deep history and prestige, being known after all, as the watchmaker’s watchmaker. but still, i should wait. that’s what i told myself...

then, it turns out that my parents-in-law wanted to buy me a watch as well, right within the price range of the jlc. so i was actually set on getting the jlc mut moon. but while going through pictures of the jlc posts here, i chanced upon the batman. that’s when i started to suay. i live in a humid country, and a leather belt would not last as long as a bracelet. i don’t often dress formally, and though the jlc would go fine with casual, the batman will go better. and if i wanted to go formal, the batman will still be able to pull it off too. 

i called my ad to ask if the batman was in stock although i knew it was impossible. sure enough i was put on a waitlist. now i was still undecided on if i should get the batman or mut moon, even up to today. that is, until i got the text that the batman was in stock today and if i wanted it. it could be mine. that was then i knew. i just had to have the batman. they say that the rarer is an object, the more you would want it. it’s all true.

tiptac,gmt,"so you would even consider their titanium ocean an homage? how about when compared to a seiko shogun which definitely was inspired by a sub but with seiko's own flavour put in the watch.

or steinhart's titanium gmt compared to tag's batman gmt. https://www.tagheuer.com/en/watches/tag-heuer-formula-1-calibre-7-automatic-watch-41-mm-waz211a-ba0875.

would you consider those watches homages as well? 

just to be clear, i'm not trying defend steinhart. just trying to have an objective discussion.",2017-07-11 01:36:15
tiptac,submariner,"yea i completely agree. personally i have nothing against homage watches. i own an ocean one myself and think it's an excellent watch. and if i see someone wearing an homage watch on the street i'd know that he's into watches and he knows his stuff. no one happens to stumble across a steinhart/squale. 

i think i was just curious at what point would you consider a watch an homage. or how far does a watch's design have to differ from an existing one before it is considered an original design. i think we're at a stage were many dive watches have been influenced by the submariner to some degree. and it's hard to say a design is truly unique like the seiko monsters/tuna.

would you consider the new titanium lineup from steinhart homages?",2017-07-11 06:38:00

for me, the gmt really is that 'only watch'. i have two and they are fantastic. i went with the black bezel as it is more understated than the batman. it has the pcl, which i personally like and makes it a bit dressier. it has the different bezel to the submariner, and it has the second timezone!! trust me, the more planes you are on and lounges you are in, you will realize the gmt is the watch of choice for frequent travellers.

details: 

'p' 2mm serial, year 2001, sapphire crystal, super bright all night superluminova, holes on the case for quick bracelet swapping (more desirable model), great finish all over having recently had a very light polish, no sapphire crystal scratches or issues. hands and markers are all made of 18k solid white gold and have no signs of rust or any sort of corrosion, like perfectly sharpened swords :)

the watch is running to cosc spec and my watchmaker just checked it and gave it a clean bill of house and a water seal test. there is very little stretch in the bracelet and the clasp works smoothly and tightly. it includes solid-end links which only the later models did (post 2000).

this is one of the only rolexes that is like having two in one, use the black bezel on the bracelet for a sleek submariner look, or put it on a nato and go camping.

there are a few tiny speck scratches on each of the genuine rolex bezels but barely noticeable and a good sign of watch character.

this is the full collector set and includes two extra links (it is sized to my 6.5"" flat wrist presently, but the quick micro adjuster is really easy to use and adds almost a link as well). included are the inner and outer boxes, the watch with both hangtags, cosc certification in leather wallet, instruction booklet and rolex company booklet. in addition the wooden box is mint and has the leather watch pillow and leather rolex embossed blanket around it. it comes with a still folded rolex polishing cloth. nothing is missing and everything looks like you bought it new today.

this watch meant a lot to me when i bought it three years ago from an ad. i searched for months to find a 2001 year model because, as a survivor of 9-11, it was the year i decided to live the life i wanted and wanted my watch to commemorate that year. it has brought me wonderful luck and i get so many compliments on the faded almost 'pink' bezel patina. really want this one to go to a great home, a first rolex purchase or a special occasion (or the highest bidder :d).

seems like i can easily get around $6k on ebay, so for a fellow redditor i'm going to offer at $5500 with free overnight shipping (if paypal you pay the fees).

since i need to make a 250 words plus comment here we go. 

hey folks,
i really like the rolex gmt-line. big fan of the sprite, also like the pepsi and batgirl. 
what do you think about this one? it was 120€. good value for the price or garbage copy? 
especially the date display is kinda weird. definitely looks off compared to a genuine rolex. i know that i only paid 120€ for it but even fake replicas have better date displays. 
but if i was to buy a rep rolex sprite, then i’d go for the high end models which cost around 400€ or more.",2024-09-05 18:42:59

best2keepquiet,gmt,"i’ve never owned a rolex, i hope to maybe some day. i have one watch i wear every day, and a seiko 5 that’s like 10 years old. my one watch is a longines that’s very simple and tasteful, but my watch inspires me and i love it. i’ve shown people the movement through the glass case back so many times and they love it, they’ve never seen anything like that before and then i get to start a conversation about watchmaking.

if i were to get another timepiece (who knows if i’ll ever be able to afford it again) it’ll probably be another longines.

rolex is rolex for a reason and they’re beautiful feats of watchmaking, and really that’s a big part of the allure.

but i like the neat, classy and unique stylings, homage to history, all those neat things longines does and is.

i don’t consider rolex a flex necessarily, it’s what you find important in the watch. i think the milgauss is one of the coolest timepieces ever made because of what it is and people think it’s totally overboard and unnecessary, and it is, or maybe not in an ever increasingly magnetically charged world.. it’s like a magnet proof bunker, i think it can withstand a lightning strike..

but for the most part rolex is absolute overkill in sensible and beautiful way and that’s awesome too. it’s complete care of that timepiece from the top down, you’re really looked after with rolex no matter what. i know a pilot with a really nice gmt, and to me that makes literal perfect sense.

for me? longines is overkill and would suit me the rest of my life just fine. even just my one watch. the dude that showed us how time is relative wore a longines, it was a gift to him, then he went out and bought himself a longines pocket watch. patek gifted him a watch they say was einstein’s watch but nope, he was a longines guy.

it would be nice to own something that i could trust to take a bit more abuse on the adventure ([longines spirit flyback titanium with the nato strap](https://www.longines.com/en-ca/p/watch-longines-spirit-l3-821-1-53-2)) side of life, but it’s daydreaming. they actually invented that flyback function, before it was wristwatches they also were the first to patent a gmt function on a pocket watch.

for me, what it represents in timekeeping, the heritage of it all, i’d probably take the flyback over a daytona. but longines is my brand i guess 🤷‍♂️

some of the old longines that turn up in the wild are just unique, beautifully designed artistic timepieces. their movements are just gorgeous, and i just really appreciate all that sort of thing so that’s what draws my attention.",2024-08-18 05:09:41
Excellent_Ruin6704,submariner,"i am nearly the same age and have had a similar experience. started with a small 34mm op and felt that initial sense of ‘first rolex’ accomplishment, bought & sold an old black exp2, got a new polar exp2 from an ad, bought & sold a tt submariner along with other brands like gs & tudor. my collection now is just the polar exp2, 2000’s era jules audemars, and a tudor pelagos blue along with a beater seiko turtle. as the years go on, ive lost the love for the ‘mainstream’ rolex & ap. it seems like people buy these models to show off wealth rather than genuine appreciation for watch collecting. you are not alone!

p.s - nice doxa!",2024-08-16 18:05:56
Zamboni4201,gmt," i can relate to your doxa while on vacation.

my collecting story is similar, although i avoided rolex.  
i thought i wanted a gmt, but early on, saw the games going on, and just didn’t want to participate.  
i’m not anti-rolex, i have a few watches on my list.  they just aren’t as important.  someday.  

looking back, i found myself chasing better watches.  there was a progression.  skx, hamilton, tudor, oris, grand seiko, iwc.  no precious metals.  it just doesn’t interest me.  

i’ve been after an omega lately, but it’s a bit hard to find.  i am not in a hurry either.  

back when i was starting out, i’d always covered better movements.  increases in accuracy and power reserve.  every leap towards my idea of perfection, there was another goal ahead.  

but one day in a department store, i saw a seiko 5.  it was exactly like my old skx.  i realized i missed my quirky, janky skx.  i still had it, but it needed service.  crown falls off, runs really slow.  it had been in a box for 10 years, i kept forgetting to send it in.  

i tried on the seiko 5, and bought it.  it brought back some nostalgia.  i like wearing it.  
it reminded me of the pre-smart phone era.  
broke, just out of college, commuting to work downtown, a watch was necessary to make connections.  

it wasn’t long after, and i realized i didn’t have to always wear a “serious” watch.  it was funny, i had a couple friends who noticed, “what’s that on your wrist?”  cracked me up.  

there are fun watches that don’t have to have spring drive levels of accuracy.  

i’ve never been into precious metals.  i don’t have to wear a _____ to “fit in” with any social group.  i’ve always worn what i want for my own reasons.  but i realized there were watches i’d skipped.  

i’ve actually been back and forth this year on an orange dial doxa, but i’m leaning toward the 200 instead of the 300.  
i just hate not being able to try it on.  same with sinn.  

i’ve also been looking at a few vintage pieces.",2024-08-16 13:56:33
Top_Lavishness4338,datejust,thanks for the input. i can absolutely agree to this and their durability. also for them being tool watches. if you noticed the ones i listed that i have i’ve definitely gone for the lesser flashy of the options with the exception of the tt datejust. i even try to dress them down more but putting them on natos which really helps me improve the tool watch vibe. but yes you make some very good points i appreciate it.,2024-08-16 14:52:19
charitytowin,gmt,"it's a watch. wear it if you like it. but it sounds like you got caught up in the hype, or at the very least, over-exposed to the watch scene to the point of overthinking the brand. 

rolex is a quality watch company. it is also a status symbol in a lot of communities, like a luis vuitton bag. that's really it. so it attracts non-watch nerds. unlike doxa, where if you're not on the calypso chances are you're a geek like me. 

i've had a lot of watches over the years, expensive and cheap, and everywhere in between. nothing has  ever fit better, been more comfortable, been better made, or kept better time than my gmt master. they're popular for a reason. 

there's a saying; first you love rolex, then you hate them for a while, then you come back to loving them again.",2024-08-16 08:39:16
Top_Lavishness4338,gmt,i wasn’t aware of that saying but i can see how a journey of collecting could take that route. i’m not saying that i hate the watches themselves. i love the watches i bought i’ve researched into them and their movements and read about their history and i love my gmt master i’ve also expressed to people they are some of the most comfortable watches i own. i think its just become too much of a status symbol and i think im finding it hard to separate myself from that aspect of it where as the other watches and brands i own i dont even have to apply that thought.,2024-08-16 13:21:19

SK_Hawkins,gmt,"hello stranger,

i say this as a fellow watch collector and enthusiast. if you have yet to buy a watch, consider what you want it for and how you'd wear it. if you get a vintage rolex--gmt or any other model--there is a steep cost to get it serviced and finding a reputable dealer. rolexes have workhorse movements. they'll run for 60 years (and then some) and in great condition so long as they are taken care of (serviced every ten years, possibly more frequently than that for more vintage movements), but fewer and fewer people will service vintage movements these days. you probably already know this as the owner of some vintage omegas. assume that you buy a vintage rolex from ebay or chrono24, it will likely have to be serviced. that's maybe a $2,000 cost in addition to the watch. if you're buying from a private seller, i highly recommend a service unless they can provide paperwork showing service from an authorized rolex service center. parts are dwindling and are going up in price because of it. most rolexes only need replacement parts if they suffer a drop, some force or water enters the watch. if you take good care of this watch (service regularly, don't put it in water if it's not fully water resistant), it will run on the same parts for another 60 years. 

depending on where you live, see if you can visit a store that sells the rolexes you're interested in. try it on, see how it fits. maybe they have something for sale on consignment. ask around. visit watch repair shops. if you don't have a watchmaker who will service rolex, or won't service vintage watches, these are things you'll want to know. would you be comfortable shipping a $10,000, $20,000 watch in the mail to go be serviced by a watchmaker you have no experience with and don't know? i have a vintage tudor submariner 7928, a rolex 1675, and a a watch likely from patek philippe/vacheron constantin from the 1920's; i have gone around asking all watch repair businesses in my city--no one will touch them. be prepared for that possibility. (i'm okay with that because i'm learning watch repair, and i know a guy who can fix rolex watches--retired but he does it--and if no one certified will fix my watches, then i'll do it.)

if you want this as your daily, do you want to be able to go swimming in it? reconsider a vintage gmt master and look into a more modern one with proven water resistance. it will break your heart to get this glorious watch (for a lot of money) to get pushed in the pool one day, learn your crown wasn't screwed down tight enough, and now your entire movement is rusted and ""unrepairable."" yikes. take it hiking? bang it against countertops? drop it while you're winding the gmt hand? think about how rough you will be with this watch and if you're going to be comfortable wearing it in public or do you have a lot of fears of being mugged or watch theft in your city. sounds like you have some other watches you'll want to wear, so think if a vintage rolex gmt master is worth spending $15,000 on a watch maybe you only wear for weddings, at graduations, special occasions. i say hold off then. wait.

that's all the cons and stuff to consider. say you try on a rolex 1675 (or other vintage/neo-vintage gmt model) and you love it. it's everything you've dreamed of and it will be your daily the rest of your life. kudos! do your homework and look into reputable dealerships and what kind of model you want. you tend to pay a premium on price, but they will tell you if they service their watches, they come with a guarantee (usually one year) for repairs, and if you give them a budget, they'll work with you within your means. if a patience says ""cool watch"" with disdain, tell them it was an inheritance or family heirloom, or say nothing at all. none of their business how you spend your money, and they're there for treatment. you both can focus on that. if they say ""cool watch"" with an open, friendly tone, yeah, tell them how stoked you are about watches. small talk can be nice. 

before i bought my rolex, i was online reading, a lot. every article i could find, information on watch repair, followed items on ebay and chrono24 to see what prices they were commanding. i did my homework so i could speak with familiarity about a rolex 1675--what movement it uses, the different dials, how to tell service dial and hands, how to date a watch. i ended up going to a watch convention in another state and some sellers had vintage rolex gmt masters, the 1675. open and friendly, they let me wear them. gods, they were gorgeous with service bezels and they had this sweet pumpkin patina and every rolex 1675 in their collection was going for about $19,675. cash. out of my price range, but the vendors were more than willing to let me ask questions and wear it even knowing i couldn't buy it. and then, after that, honestly, i just got lucky on ebay (because i was spending so much time on the internet i had saved ""favorite searches"" and was following various sellers). a guy was selling his personal rolex 1675 after owning it for 30 years. i happened to win the bid for a song compared to a dealership price, but it's not running well and the seller was upfront about it being 12 years from the last service. it might end up being a bear to fix, and if i want to keep this watch, i have to sell others in my collection to justify the purchase. that said, i love it. i love the scratches and the dents and the faded pepsi bezel, and the slight patina, i love the look of this watch and despite it being nearly 40mm, this watch fits beautifully on my wrist. it's a mark 1 dial with a long e and from the late 1960's. i can't wait to work on this watch. 

as always, buy the seller. if you can't trust the seller, for gods sakes, do not buy from them.

Exact-Anything1383,gmt,"it’s a classic, classy, utilitarian watch which truly holds to the original concept of a “tool watch.” 

the gmtii advantage over the original is that you can set the hour hand with the quickset option, saving a lot of rotations on the crown. 

the aluminum-inset bezel is fantastic because, in addition to permitting one easily to track three time zones, it has a very practical application as a simple timer. need to check the grill in 20 minutes? spin the triangle to twenty minutes from now. the pre-ceramic bezel is better able to do this because it has 120 detents in a full-rotation. the ceramic gmt has only 24 detents in a full rotation. what this means in practice is that you are able to precisely align the arrow on the aluminum inset to any minute mark along the minute track.

hollow center links make the og bracelet significantly lighter than the modern version of the bracelet. and polished center links are lame. 

most importantly, you have worked incredibly hard to get into a good college, and worked incredibly hard to earn your way into a good med school, and worked incredibly hard to graduate med school and are now preparing to enter a demanding profession. you deserve to reward yourself with a memento to mark your hard work and achievement. you’d like to own a vintage rolex gmt to be this memento? well earned! go for it!",2025-04-12 18:44:52

you have to buy what you want to wear.  

who cares what watchuseek thinks?   if we all obeyed watchuseek’s advice, the world would be a dull place.
in the big picture, they’re a very tiny fraction of the population.  
honestly, unless they’re buying it for you, i wouldn’t worry about what they say.  

i bought an skx in the mid-2000’s because i liked the pepsi divers.  i wore the crap out of that thing.  over the years, i have added other watches, including a tudor gmt pepsi.  

a friend has a pepsi turtle, wears it all the time.  it’s a step up from the 5 divers.  if i had to step up, i think i like a samurai more than a turtle, but to each their own.  

a few years back, i saw an srpd53 in a store, on sale, and realized i missed my seiko pepsi.  so, i bought it, and i do wear it.  i have other more expensive watches, but there’s nothing wrong with a 5 diver.  

i do miss the screw down crown from the skx, but i like hacking/handwinding.  and it has occurred to me to go get an nh movement, stuff it into my skx, and i’d then have hacking/handwinding for my old skx.  i just haven’t done it.  

homage watches are fine, if that’s what you want.  it’s my understanding that steinhart does a good job.  personally, i don’t like buying a watch unless i can try it on first.

i like the tudor as well but ultimately the pepsi look isn’t as versatile imo, and at that price point it is still a high end piece that is a target for theft or that i would feel bad damaging. it all comes down to personal preference but for me tudor is in a weird middle ground where i would rather have a seiko or used omega instead",2023-09-21 15:46:33

cosc is an amazing feature to have. most unique design by far...sure some omega elements like the broad arrow and lugs but the bezel? the gmt hand? they are truly serious about their watch design but also will not compromise on specs, and that's why it's more expensive.
a lot of people may choose like farer or baltic, but i don't think it's a fair comparison. below 1k, you can get good designs but the quality is not there. i say this as a happy owner of baltics.

BluesMaster,gmt,"i've no use whatsoever for a gmt watch, but what i don't like about many gmt watches is that many give the gmt hand a prominence (e.g. via size and/or colour) that immediately draws the eye. 

i'd like the gmt hand to be the hand that draws the eye last, not first.

my personal favourite (not a microbrand), is the (sadly) discontinued **alpina startimer pilot heritage gmt** ref al-555lns4h6, illustrated review [here](https://monochrome-watches.com/alpina-startimer-pilot-heritage-gmt-hands-on-price/).

> the alpina startimer utilizes a disc with an arrow pointer to tell the second time zone instead of a hand. this gives the dial a very slow-moving 24-hour cycle but it’s also a really cool feature for a gmt. the gmt time zone is managed by a second crown at 2 o’clock that allows the time and date to be set independently of the gmt zone.

Ahelou,gmt,"i heard about this too, but alot of people saying this was before they brought things in-house (they do also have a non in-house line that's cheaper). i can only speak from my own experience and i've not had any issues. 
the bezel movement can be smoother, and the gmt is not a true traveller gmt, that's where my criticism stops.

if you're based in the us, they released a statement that for the next few months they'll be absorbing the tariff increases, so that's a plus.

dwchambers,gmt,"i think it’s fairly subjective. the 9075 is one of miyota’s “premium” offerings, but i think most of the hype around it is due to it being a true gmt as opposed to a caller gmt in the cases of sellita and soprod. having seen both the sellita and soprod gmt movements, and having experience with other miyota movements, i find the finishing and quality to be far superior on sellita and soprod. the biggest annoyance with miyotas, for me, is the rotor and winding sounds. they sound scratchy and cheap to my ears, and miyota 9075 owners have stated that the 9075 has those same classic miyota sounds. 

the accuracy of farer’s top grade sellita and serica’s cosc certified soprod will also beat the miyota. if you like a display case back, the sellita on the farer is beautiful.  

i think in the watch hobbyist space, affordable movements with notable features get a lot of traction. comparing apples to apples, though, i don’t think the miyota is all that awesome, but maybe for its price it is. and certainly the gmt watches that microbrands have been able to make because of it are cool.",2023-09-10 19:53:58

if i had to nitpick, some corners are a bit sharp. people knock the brand for doing homages, but this one is an original design and i think its a good direction for the brand.

mostly use off the shelf workhorse movements, like the nh35/nh35/pt5000 etc. which you can see as a pro or a con.

I_wanna_ask,gmt,"1. it's your watch. wear it as you see fit. 

that being said, if you are concerned about image and crime, here are a few things i would recommend (please note i am assuming you don't wear a watch every day): 

1. wear a beater watch. some kind of cheaper dive watch (get a casio for under 100 pounds). learn how to act when you wear it. the first time you consistently wear a watch, you will ding it and scratch it. if you want to avoid that on the gmt, you should wear a daily for a few months to learn how to make changes in your daily mannerisms so you minimize risk to the watch. 

2. you want to keep the watch safe. the safest thing you could probably do is find a bank and keep it in a safety deposit box. that being said, it sounds like you are in a part of town where people will notice a nice rolex on the wrist, especially if they see you every day and if you are walking home late at night. now may not be the best time to be wearing it. no watch is ever worth your life, but i also know you would be devastated should you end up having to surrender the watch in a robbery.  on this angle alone, i would ask your mother to hold onto the watch a bit longer until you are living in a better situation. also, insure the watch asap if you can. god forbid it gets stolen, at least your dad's fiscal sacrifice can pay off and help you however you may need. 

3. at work: there is something to be said about younger employees who dress flashy and ""above their station."" your goal is probably more to blend in and make friends, not isolate yourself. will a rolex ostracize you? probably not, but at the same time, take a look at what other people are wearing on their wrist. odds are it's a smart watch, but maybe you can find a watch that is ""fun"" for an engineer like a watch with a slide rule bezel. that being said, i wouldn't worry too much about this. if people do care, they'll ask about the rolex and you'll have a heartwarming story that won't make people angry at you. don't worry about this as a reason to not wear the watch.  

personally, if it was me, right now i would only wear it for special events when i can be sure the watch will be safe after. once i find myself in a more secure living situation, that watch would be glued to my wrist except for when it needs to be serviced. in my own opinion, the scratches and dings that come with wearing it daily add charm and meaning to the watch, and i would want to carry a moment of my dad wherever i go.",2023-08-24 11:46:05

when i look past the hype and the hate on both ends of the spectrum, i'm still intrigued by what i believe to be rolex's unique value proposition which is that they make a product that's highly recognizable, highly engineered for durability, longevity, and practicality, only moderately highly finished, and yet still manages to hold its value and be perceived as an incredible luxury. to me it feels like a really bizarre thing for rolex to be the king of luxury. it would be like if toyota were considered the pinnacle of luxury automobiles. how on earth did they pull that off?

if i ignore all that and only consider the aesthetics and functionality of the watches, i still find rolex compelling. do i find them overpriced from this perspective? absolutely. but you simply can't ignore the fact that their designs are iconic, and it's not like they don't bring any engineering and functionality to the table. even if rolex weren't rolex, their watches would still be expensive and considered luxury tier.

and finally, all these ad stories only make me more intrigued. i'm playing the ad game myself now trying to get some pieces at msrp. why? i dunno. all the reasons above, plus sheer morbid curiosity about how the process would really go for me. i went into it knowing exactly what to expect, with my eyes open, a game plan, and low expectations.

what has it been like so far? pretty anticlimactic, but enjoyable. i first visited an ad in december last year. they of course had nothing to sell me with a crown on it. i chit-chatted about watches and tried on a bunch of stuff, had a good rapport with the sales associate i was working with, put my name on the possibly imaginary waitlist for a couple pieces, and went on my way. it was a fun visit, and i had no expectations, so no harm done. since then, the sa has, to my surprise kept, in pretty regular contact with me and we've built up a bit of a regular cadence of checking in with each other. it started with him texting me random pieces he thought i'd be interested in. everything from seikos to carl f bucherer watches that cost as much as a rolex. he hasn't been pressuring me to buy them, just reaching out to me with things he finds interesting because him and i are both fans of watches beyond just rolex. did i buy anything from him since then? yes, absolutely. i know how the game works, and i'm playing it. i do have limits for myself though. i'm not buying anything i wouldn't otherwise buy, but i'm trying to give business to this ad when i can. i bought a tudor black bay ceramic i was genuinely interested they didn't have when i first visited, and 2 seiko watches and some earrings both for my wife. i know this seems like some forced purchases given i've only been at this since december, but my wife's birthday, christmas, and valentines day have all occurred over these few months, so it truly wasn't forced. i was actually offered one rolex, a datejust. it wasn't a crappy configuration either. it was the classic yellow gold fluted jubilee champagne dial iconic datejust, i just didn't want that to be my first purchase. i'm really hoping for a green bezel submariner, blue milgauss, or wimbledon datejust. again, i want specific things, and i'm not going to compromise just to get the first possible allocation. some people would tell me it was a huge mistake to turn down that datejust, but i don't believe it was. the sa said no big deal he wants me to get what i want he was just offering it to me for the sake of offering it to me because it unexpectedly became available after the person it was intended for backed out. we're still in regular contact and the latest purchase i made was only a couple weeks ago. i have no idea when i'll get allocated any of the specific pieces i actually want. i know the submariner is in very high demand, the milgauss isn't very high demand but it's also not produced in large quantities either, and the datejust is generally the easiest model to get but i'm looking for a very very specific configuration. 

the one thing i'm not at all interested in, is the grey market. at this price point i don't even want to have to think about fakes and frankenwatches and all that crap. plus the more i see of the grey market the more skeezy it feels to me. i'm just not interested. not my scene. i know there are good grey market dealers out there, but there's just way too many guys whose entire business is firing off mass texts in whatsapp groups they paid for access to while acting like they're some kind of business tycoon who actually probably learned everything they know from tiktok. besides, what fun is buying the most hyped brand in the world if you're going to skip the entire hazing ritual that earns you the right to buy in? you're not a true rolex owner if you didn't get jerked around by an ad  for 9 months or spend 5x the price of your watch on jewelry, right? right? heh... ok maybe this is silly. but screw it. i'm in it now.",2023-02-25 05:29:50

hotsunami,submariner,"my rolex ad is pretty normal and does not fit the weird criteria of being overly exclusive or anything. i simply told them i wanted a rolex submariner and would be ready to buy in november (it was july at the time). was told it was not a problem. they called me first week of november and said they had a submariner and if i was still interested. went and picked it up the next day. surprisingly easy process and did not pay above msrp. 

now i know how much flack rolexes and submariners get in general. however, the submariner for me was not going to be a daily wear or something to flash. it was simply something to celebrate a milestone and to use for diving. it’s a beautiful watch and although many would easily say it carries a significant doosh factor, i would not argue against it. for me it’s a great tool to keep and track time under water. it also happens to be quite good at it. it has its own charm. 

if one starts to avoid things that are perceived as dooshy, we simply help assist make them gain exclusivity. why do we not do this for patek or audemars? maybe i have not reddit enough and miss the point, and therefore, i apologize for the rant.",2023-02-25 13:32:27
Red986S,gmt,"these days wearing a rolex screams “my dad has a construction business” or “i’m a big crypto guy” and if not one of those or both, you can also throw in “i have money and it’s important that everyone else knows it.”

i’m none of those guys, and *especially* not the third one, so owning a rolex is pretty incompatible with my personality, which was the biggest thing i learned by owning one. i would be embarrassed to wear it because i didn’t want people sizing me up by looking at my wrist, and while i especially liked the history and classic design of the vintage (and considerably less blingy) 5513, it still felt increasingly weird to have it on my wrist. so, i sold mine. 

personally, i prefer a tudor. same basic watch in a ton of ways, but the only person who’s going to notice that on my wrist probably understands why i’d be wearing it, which is because i like watches and they make nice ones. it’s not really all that much of a flex to show up anywhere with a bbgmt on your wrist and that’s just how i like it.

all that said, reddit is not real life. it’s not like your only two options are new from the ad and new from the gray market at a premium. there are plenty of vintage and even plenty of newer but not brand new rolexes that can be had at reasonable prices, and the fact that a lot of people gloss right over this tells me it means more to have something other people can’t have to a lot of them. which is silly, because if you need to have a new rolex to be satisfied with it, i have bad news about this thing called “the passage of time” (which, conveniently, can be measured by a rolex no matter if it’s new or several years old)… a year from now your watch will just be last year’s model and then what?",2023-02-24 19:02:55
Lsclancy9,datejust,i have sold most of my rolex pieces. people are paying way to much and even i have a price lol..i have kept my first one a two tone datejust purchased back in the 70's somewhere around 2k. another one that my wife purchased for me is the yacht master stainless with the platinum bezel. afte i sold my 36mm gold day/date president my ad called and asked if i wanted the new one...yes but i did not pay over msrp. i have been going more towards the omega catralog and a few micro brands. until rolex ad's change there ways i wont be purchasing anymore of there product . i actually dont feel the issues are all rolex's fault i blame alot of the flexing bullshit on the social media..because some piece of s--t rap artist wears one people think they have to have one. anyway...jmo,2023-02-24 18:11:00

i've been looking elsewhere for my next luxury watch, but am having a hard time finding what i need (sub 40mm, gada type piece) outside of rolex.

the first obvious candidate is the omega aqua terra in 38.5mm, but i don't love how they implemented the date window (and wish they just did a no-date version, tbh...)

there's the tudor bb36, but the dial is too close to the sub, and the crown juts out too far.

so now we come full circle, to the rolex explorer, recently released in the classic 36mm size.  i have a 6.5"" boney wrist, and i suspect that if i were actually able to try one on at an ad they would make a sale that day.",2023-02-24 19:03:53

Fantazma03,submariner,big big turn off for me. honestly i used to liked the simple oyster perpetual yrs ago. until hype came 🤡. reality is if you remove the overhype and overprice of their watches people will look elsewhere. then theres the toxic owners that tries really hard to explain and justfy that a ss submariner is worthy of $20k+ or a ss daytona for $34k+. it just proves that the wealthy are the most stupid buyers than poor ones 🤡 for me its not a watch anymore. its just an overpriced to the moon stainless steel on your wrist that tells time,2023-02-25 05:10:09

Big-Shtick,gmt,"i think people put way, way too much stock into rolex as a luxury brand. rolex putting lipstick on a pig doesn't negate the fact that all their r&d goes toward longevity, serviceability, durability, reliability, and accuracy.

my only watch is a 114270 explorer. i'm pretty hard on it. it's dinged and scratched to shit because i never take it off unless i'm sleeping/showering. yes, better watches exist. you can buy a jlc perpetual calendar for less than a used sky dweller, which only offers annual calendar and gmt complications. 

but if someone wants a watch they can wear while shoveling shit at work all day, wear out at night with your better half, and have it tick at +2 spd the entire time, rolex is a fantastic option. just like how it used to be.",2023-02-25 00:45:19

SirSamkin,submariner,"i like rolex, and i want to own a milgauss because i like the green crystal and lightning bolt hand.

that said, what kind of accuracy are you seeing on youtube? the “superlative” standard seems to be a 4 second deviation, compared to the 5 second deviation of the master chronometer. the difference here being the rolex is allowed to be up to 2 seconds slow, while the omega isn’t allowed to be slow at all. 

and as i said, “superlative chronometer” is meaningless until it’s an independently audited standard that all watchmakers can pursue, and you the customer can see the results of. i can type in my serial number on omega’s site and see how my individual watch performed on every single test. 

rolexes are also very accurate watches, but i think that 3rd party auditing is huge.

as far as serving goes, omega suggests 5 to 8 years, but i think it’s fair to say it’s because they’ve got to maintain the more stringent master chronometer standard, and watches tend to slow as the oils gum up. a rolex submariner is allowed to be up to 2 seconds slow, so it can stretch the interval and still be in standard, whereas an omega operating at the same 2 seconds slow would be out of standard. i’m sure an omega could go much longer without service if you don’t care about the mc standard, since the coaxial escapement operates with much reduced wear to the standard escapement used in pretty much every other watch.",2023-02-25 17:58:08

4. a regular date window. no cyclops.

Captainmorgan696969,gmt,"found it for a crazy deal at a very small uk retailer.  i ha e seen them on ebay for about 1200 pounds and i asked a sale retail or about the price he said even if i scratched it up a bit i could sell it for more than  550 pounds (price i paid)

it was a lucky find. 

i did see some for 880 and i think g offered one to me for just under a grand. 

my fathers 6542 was stolen from him in hospital and while i plan on starting a microbrand with a hz6460 or 7000 series (maybe stp) it's not safe to visit china atm the summer or next year hopefully but it's to hard to get it done online, vintage gmt using double domed sapphire and have a wr of at least 200m without being in the factory in person + the factory not having an example 

my family had a brand from about 1870/1880 to ww2. 

if i did it online i would need alot of prototypes and that's just cost prohibitive. 

but untul then this is to scratch my gmt urge and if something happened to it i would be not happy but 55o is not the end of the world. 

for the movement and quality (i checked and the case, hands, bezel and dial are acthakg swiss swiss not sure about the bracelet but very high quality. 

i lived in china and most watches unde romega and many over are all chinese made apart from the movement...... 

paying any more in the uk (price i clude 20 percent sales tax also known as vat) would be  diminishing returns. 

just hope the sw330 is well regulated.",2023-01-22 03:26:45
Captainmorgan696969,gmt,"the quality is realy great i know it has no glide lock but the clasp it has is very well made has enough micro ajust points and a nice extendor, i was a little worried the jubelee would not be great but its realy well made but was a nightmare to first size.

it's running +3 for me on its first day (i did wear it to bed) after 2 months of breaking i may use the micro ajust.

the movement is a huge upgrade over the 2824 as in you can't realy feel yourself winding it and not a peep from the rotor.

i do like the 120 click bi directional bezel mine has a little play but i would assume thats normal with a 120 bi

after never seeing a squale in the flesh i was expecting lower end search group quality like hamilton but its more closer to the older tudors.

i did call sqale and they ci firmed that the cases. dials and hands, bezel and parts of the bracelet are legit swiss made as in not made in china like most swiss brands and finished in switzerland. that surprised me. 

what's the bezel action and speed on yours like new and now? 

i only realy got into watches more after my father's death, i had a few before that but now i realy need a watch box or roll. 

i have

omega dress watch from the late 50s. 
handwind.

i have a bag of nh35 movements may do a build. 

i have 4 new vostoks i bought 2 days into the invasion when the rouble dropped and they are going up in price managed to get them for under 20 pounds per amphibia. 

i sell seagull 1963 38mm and 40mm sapphires , steeldive 1970 (williard) 1953 (sub) and 1975 (tuna) 

62 mas 41mm. 

i may keep a 39mm and 36mm tandorio after i change dials but new in box so may sell same with a 37mm unimatic cali from them but it does not fit well. 


but going from low end russian and chinese to japanese and then swiss to higher end swiss realy makes you appreciate the little things when you have a new watch. 

i did get all the chinese watches for dealer prices, i lived in china most of my adult life with a few years in the us before covid and most watches are all made in china apart from the movement. 

but for less than 2 san martin gmts or fancy seiko 5s in the uk or 1 tissot powermatic i managed to find this lovely squale and i could honestly say it fits every criteria for a 1 watch collection. 

it's thin so does not look out of place with a suit, looks great casual, 30atm means i can use it as a dive watch as the 120 clicks means i can time with it plus i do travel well did alot before covid. 

since i live in the gmt time zone i put the gmt hand to the time in beijing (business and my wife's family) and then weekdays the bezel on eastern us or us pacific time (if i'm messing with forex markets or the strange opening and closing of businesses that go by pacific. 

i suppose if i was in imprisoned in a dark room the gmt could tell me what time of day it is but i'm sure they would take the watch lol

i think i need a watch roll as traveling with a watch box could be a pain. 

it's a shame as the prices of warches in the uk are insane and if u want something shipped from the us its 20%vat plus extra shipping plus a 10 dollar + customs handling fee. 

i think if i went straight to a high end watch i would not appreciate it so much. 

i think anything more than this squale is just heavily diminishing returns. 

i think people look at vintage rolex watches from rose lenses as the movements are 18,000 to 19800bph, no hacking.
no solid end links, stamped clasps, no click bezels (similar to vostoks) 

still great warches but i could see someone used to modern watches paying a fortune for a vintage rolex or omega and being very disappointed lol. 

as long as is backhacks safely, handwinds and keeps good time it's ok with me. 

i first imagined the 2892/3 base movements  to be a slight upgrade over the 2824 base movements but they are a huge upgrade.",2023-01-22 13:07:44
Captainmorgan696969,gmt,"i think it's just a 120 bi it just has a little play and i'd rather that than 120uni or 24bi

at least with this i can use it as a gmt and a count down bezel or in nations that have half hours and even quarter hour differences.

i actually use a bezel as a timer quite often. 


mine has no real grit, but i'm sure it will get smoother with time and a little silicone.

i still need to wash the oil out of the bracelet in some warm soapy water but it does not make noise so no rush.

but every few mo ths i usually put a smudge of thin silicone between the bezel and on the stem tube threads and at the top to keep it smooth and protected from water.

i hope it breaks into +1 but the micro ajust is so easy on eta type movements.

just hope i'm in china come service time as its cheap to get it serviced over their, in the uk may as well get a new movement, i knew a guy who serviced watches for a good price but he went away.

my dad also would have been really pleased with that, as long as he never found out how much it cost 🤣

TwoStitchStraps,gmt,"the 1675 was the only gmt model produced by rolex from 1959 to 1980. it became incredibly popular and was, in typical rolex’s style, incrementally improved throughout those 21 years. because of that, there is a lot of variation of dials, hands, movements, and case components, often bringing a headache to the collectors. our favorite variant is, of course, the pepsi, especially when paired with the fine leather strap like this honey leather with custom stitching to match the bezel colors.

fx12003,gmt,"wow, really tough question haha.  they are all pretty special to me.  to cheat, i think i can pick my three favorites:

\- the zenith was the first nice watch i ever bought myself.  it was also a brand i had aspired to for a long time when i was interested in watches but did not feel like i could afford any.  so, that, plus other life events around the time i purchased will forever make it the most meaningful to me in my collection.

\- the omega has been the watch i wore every day for many years.  it has also traveled with me on every work or fun vacation adventure i have ever been on as an adult.  so, a really meaningful watch for me that takes a beating.  i love all the scratches i put on it.

\- the breguet was my wedding watch and has been on just about every formal life event (happy or sad) that i have been to, so had some meaningful travel too.  also, a really important brand in my interest in watches.

(third place tie - the rolex - it came in honor of another major life event and, however silly as the game one plays for retail rolex is, after spending many years trying to get it, actually finally getting it is satisfying and special.   i always wanted a gmt complication, and i thought this would be the perfect piece.  as a watch collector, rolex was always a brand i was aware of but never really sought out.  this has been a really cool way of getting to know the brand more.)",2022-10-09 05:35:21

i know one thing for damn sure though… 

rolex is one of the most iconic, instantly-recognizable, and revered brands in the world. you could make the argument that it’s in the running for most iconic brands in the history of mankind. you don’t get to that spot by making hesitant strategic decisions or being unaware of your place and perception in the market. you can bet that rolex knows **exactly** what it’s doing. and the amount of watches it churns out each year is carefully planned down to the sku (save for the pandemic impacts). 

speaking of, where are you getting this 200k number? [everything i’ve read](https://www.watchpro.com/rolex-accounts-for-one-quarter-of-entire-swiss-watch-industrys-annual-turnover/?amp) says they made just over 800k watches in 2020, a drop of 19%. i have to believe that if rolex’s output dropped a whopping 80% in a single year, daytona resale prices would be 10x more obscene.",2021-10-17 07:42:52

i've been on the fence about what my rugged travel watch would be. i wanted a watch that i could throw on when i'm going to a different timezone and that could be used during a hike, jet skiing and a nice dinner in the evening. something that i could knock around and not worry that it would be too delicate and break on me. 

that left me with one choice. the gmt master ii. i decided on the pepsi with the sweet blue dial as blue is my favorite color.

just this week though, my wife apparently called them to inquire again since i have a major birthday coming up. a day later, she got a call, and we picked it up today. i’m still over the moon. the bezel does change color depending on the type and intensity of the light. the jubilee is comfortable, and i think i love that it won’t show wear as much as the polished center links on the 116710blnr. there’s a high probability that i will wear this daily.

two integrated bracelet options that really catch my eye are the zenith defy classic line or the gp laureatos. check out the laureato chronos which are around $10k. it’s the upper crust of watch making for less than a sub. the non chronos are gorgeous too. 

i’m also leaning towards a classic datejust. like the aqua terra can be a one watch collection. it’s a total icon.",2020-10-09 05:38:53

kwansaw94,gmt,"you kind of do have to be insistent, maybe even come up with a heartfelt story. i would even go into the ad a couple of times per week to talk to the manager. cold-calling ad’s is unlikely to work because they are wary of flippers. the sad truth is that ad’s reserve the stainless steel for their bigger spenders. you buy $x and they give you access to certain watches. they don’t really say this explicitly but it’s heavily implied that that is how you “build on your relationship.” i was at gearys with a person that bought a patek pilot watch, he asked the dealer to sweeten the deal by letting him buy a ss batman gmt master from them. they brought it out and then my friend said that he made a mistake and that he actually meant that he wanted a pepsi gmt. the manager kind of hesitated and pretended that it was impossible, but they lo and behold, they brought out the pepsi from the back within 5 minutes after pretending to having searched for it. my friend bought the patek and the rolex, and 10 minutes later was cursing himself for not asking for a daytona.

i've now had 3 pepsi watches. i had a 16700, then determined i wanted to get the new ceramic when it was launched in 2018. after spending about year and a half on the wait list and not hearing a word for an update, i went and put my name on the list for the tudor. then, about 2 months after going on the list for the tudor i got the call for the rolex, then the tudor came in about 2 months after that.

i kept both in my collection for nearly a year, and honestly, wanted to appeal to the rational side of my brain and convince myself that the tudor could help me forget about the rolex, and then flip the gmt master. but the rolex got significantly more wear. so the tudor is off to find a new owner.

that being said, just about any sub can be sold for a profit in a year or two. plus you could probably find one from the year you started your business. that would add a little sentimentality that only you two know about. i think that would be a really cool detail to the story if you hand them down to your kids. and i loooove two-tone models.
