exocett909,speedmaster,"flexibility and micro adjustments.  i am always very aware of how tight or loose my watch bracelet is so if i can easily adjust on the fly i am always happy. for instance the tudor t-fit clasp on my black bay 54 always allows me to have the perfect size no matter the weather or my activity level. 
my newest model speedmaster is kind of frustrating. with only two positions on the adjustment i actually find i am in the middle of the amount of links i want to have on the watch. extremely picky i know but it is what it is. i have that speedy on a fabric strap for this reason",2025-05-07 15:55:15

ShiftySiwft,speedmaster,"all though i’m sure what you’re saying about the above is true, in this particular case snoopy is related to the american space program. omega was awarded the sliver snoopy award (nasa award given to employees and contractors for outstanding achievement related to space flight) due to the speedmasters role in the timing of the apollo 13 burns that saved the crew. in the 50th anniversary edition apollo xiii is engraved in the case back and the flight trajectory is engraved on the watch strap. the role of snoopy in nasa goes back to the apollo 1 fire that killed the crew. nasa wanting to make a character to represent the importance of safety and boost morale. snoopy was picked for his charm and he was also commonly depicted as a pilot in the peanuts show.",2025-05-06 15:32:25

bernard_hossmoto,speedmaster,"your law firm does not matter, however a speedmaster is always a good choice - you can not go wrong!

i would suggest either the classic black one or (my new personal favorite) the white one, they both go with any clothing. avoid colors or gold.  
keep in mind, that the speedmaster is hand wound and not automatic. always get it on the bracelet, you can get inexpensive leather straps later.

DarthTsar,speedmaster,"i wonder if you should rethink about your assumptions.

i can't speak for people around you but to trust a lawyer, i need to see his resume and reputation and definitely not the watch he's wearing. maybe you should see if people around where you live really care about watches or not.

for me, watches are personal. the only thing is if i see bad taste, that may put me off a bit. if you're worried about first impressions.

if they do care infact about watches, speedmaster is really a cool watch. what's not to like about it?",2025-05-06 09:44:45
thesliu5,speedmaster,"find a reputable independent service shop that has done vintage speedmasters before.  commenters have already given good advice on how to approach the service of the watch, but i wanted to point out that you have 516 endlinks and a flatlink bracelet.  the endlinks themselves can be worth up to $500.  the bracelet in decent condition can be worth over $1000 (if it is a 1039 bracelet- you should be able to see the bracelet ref# on the clasp).  you should definitely take care to not lose those and see if someone can get the bracelet restored as well.",2025-05-05 22:22:16
Mildredtheminx,speedmaster,"looks like a 321 calibre 4th or 5th generation speedmaster, the 321 calibre speedmasters are some of the most collectable of the vintage speedmasters and looks like it's on the original bracelet too!

crown and pushers look like they've been (terribly) replaced with ones no where near original spec so worth getting those replaced with ones closer to original spec.

keep all the rest (especially dial, hands and bezel) as is, as replacing original parts destroys the originality of the watch. if any parts do need replacing (possibly a new crystal) get the watchmaker to give you the original parts, probably best to request not to polish either etc.

ignorethesquid,speedmaster,"this is likely a 145.022 if it’s from 1970. if you’re unsure about the year there’s a chance it could be a 145.012 which is more valuable as it has a 321 movement (this was the last reference with that movement, the caliber they used on the original moon landings). unscrew the caseback if you can and it should have a reference number.  either way this is a “pre moon” speedmaster and will look great with a little restoration. i bet the dial is in good condition and even just replacing the pusher and crystal and servicing it will make a huge difference. echoing others, don’t send it to omega. also, if that’s the original bracelet those are also pretty rare and add to the overall value.",2025-05-05 22:06:45
Devo11711,speedmaster,"looks like a speedmaster 145.012 that's definitely seen some better days, but it's an absolute gem of a watch - mine's pretty much been my daily wear for the past year

the crown is definitely aftermarket, since omega used a full stainless crown on the watch originally.

it's hard to tell, but it seems like the hands and possibly the dial have been re-lumed, since they usually patina to a tan-brown color, since they're using tritium lume. the lume should usually look like this on a 145.012:

thesliu5,speedmaster,"omega won't help you find a vintage bracelet unless you happen to run into a particularly nerdy salesperson. and they definitely won't help you source one. they are only interested in selling you a new one. for a 1974, you're looking for an 1171 bracelet with 633 endlinks or an 1175 with 640 endlinks. there's also the holzer ""mexican presidential"" bracelet, but it's quite a bit less popular and isn't specifically evocative of particular vintages of speedmasters; if you want to be era-specific, you'd find an 1171 or 1175 combo.

i also will drop the hot take that the 3821 looks better in its  original black dial wear variant. many will disagree and to be honest the speedmaster looks good in any color, but thats because it’s just that great of a design. this is all very subjective of course, but you are choosing against several watches that are iconically white-dial-watches. 

the explorer ii is a great looking watch. i’m not a big fan of rolex but this is one of my favorite. it’s a bit chunky, but unlike the more elegant snowflake, it’s knows what it is.

gs? maybe. well, i don't know. i have seen these in real life, and they are amazing. gs is very underrated, but imo slightly overpriced. it has not conquered its place in market yet to ask the prices they are asking. but this is an option.

EasyPacer,speedmaster,"the ""date thingey"" and the sub-dial description along with ""automatic"" tells me that it isn't the more revered speedmaster professional, otherwise known as the ""moon watch"" - something that omega likes to claim as ""the first watch worn on the moon"". on the pre-owned market, depending on vintage and condition, the moon watch will be anywhere between usd4500 to usd6000. nevertheless the auto speedy is a nice watch. it is the basis for many of omega's motor racing themed watches.

as to value, that'll be around usd1200-1500 depending on condition. the box and papers help if you intend to sell. but i would recommend that you hang onto it as an heirloom to subsequently pass it on further down the generations. it will have more sentimental value than it would monetary value.

getting the watch resized will be no issue. it's actually very easy with the right tools. omega boutique will likely do that at no charge. at any other watch shop, they will probably charge you a small fee, i would exoect that to be no more than usd30.",2025-05-01 11:34:57

CrimsonStrand,aqua terra,"my first recommendation would have been the aqua terra, but given that i am assuming you saw it in person, it might not exactly fit the bill here.

i would say a grand seiko might be the right pick for you. popular picks would be the snowflake, shunbun and white birch but there are plenty of picks to choose from.

aside from that, a rolex explorer 36 might be available for around 7-8k depending on the reference number, but as much as the watch is versatile, it might also come of as boring (which maybe saying something about my taste since it's my favorite rolex 😅)

there are many, many more excellent options to consider which people will no doubt recommend. my last pick perhaps would have been the tudor bb58 gmt, but the aesthetic is perhaps not attuned to dressing up such as the ones above.

all the best in your search, hope you find the perfect pick for you 😊",2025-04-28 21:16:37

Givingbacktoreddit,speedmaster,"i’ve already seen this hypothetical and it’s a pretty easy pick. cartier santos. similar in ruggedness but it can function as a traditional dress watch especially if you put it on a black leather strap.

speedmaster is worn to any event up to business formal. submariner is worn from business casual to business formal. santos is worn from business formal and above.

obviously if you don’t care about what is traditionally acceptable then any of these watches are capable of being worn during any occasion except water, only the submariner should go near water.

next you absolutely need an apple watch for the functionality and a g-shock of some variety because even though these are all “rugged” watches you don’t want to get wear and tear marks on your multi-thousand dollar piece because of excessive abuse. for example, while you could dive with a submariner why scuff the bracelet on a rock face? you could wear the speedmaster to the gym but why not wear a watch that can track your progress, time your sets, and is easily washed?

to enhance the collection further i’d either go for a more traditional dress watch like a jaeger-lecoultre reverso duoface, a fun dial like a grand seiko snowflake, a flex watch, or more complications like a gmt/moonphase.",2025-04-30 02:24:40

i have a brosnan seamaster that was my wedding watch and this glassbox carrera. to me, when you pick a wedding watch, it is something you will keep forever and pass on to kids one day. pick something you will enjoy every day, treat it like your marriage, take care of it, cherish it, but don't be afraid to take it out and wear it. make memories with it besides wearing it at the wedding, have it in photographs and family photos, so that when your kids one day get the watch, it means something to them too.

this one is the first generation reduced. omega made a second generation for a few years that had a sapphire crystal, much more scratch resistant then the hesalite (aka acrylic) on this one. also slightly redesigned dial, upgraded water resistance, and bracelet clasp.

DrNoOne,speedmaster,"disclaimer: feel free to like what you like, and if you enjoy your speedmaster or plan to buy one, good for you, the following is my opinion on how i choose watches.

the main reason to get a speedy would be the connection to the moon landing. that watch was steel with a black dial, had the 361 movement, plexiglas crystal, plain no display case back.

the move to the 861 and more recently to coaxial, the ""flight qualified by nasa"" or the sapphire sandwitch case back, the (way too many) special dials and precious metal editions, have contributed to what i call the disneyfication of the speedy. instead of a watch with a genuine link to the history of space exploration, you get something out of a souvenir shop.

allgonetoshit,speedmaster,"he seems like he already has a lot of watches and i'm more of a quality over quantity person myself, so i will ask, does it have to be a watch? your budget is in cad, so i will assume you are in canada.

  
what about a really nice custom strap for his speedmaster? something from aaronbespoke? aaron is an amazing guy and he'll gladly work with you to find something your husband will like:

also, does your husband have nice strap tools, not chinese knockoffs, but really nice stuff from bergeon. you can find that stuff at amazon and local places like perrin

RegressToTheMean,speedmaster,"i think the collection could use a dress watch.

that aside - and i get this is probably opposite most people's thoughts - i think the collection is boring.

don't get me wrong, they are all excellent well made watches (and i'm heading to an omega boutique tomorrow to check out a speedmaster in person) and people should love what they own, but it's like the cliche r/watches collection.

personally, i love seeing collections and watches that aren't the same watches everyone posts. i wish lesser known brands like [rgm watch co](https://www.rgmwatches.com/) would make more appearances.

i'd love to hear about and see lesser known brands or unique/rare styles more often instead of the same 20 watches.

edit: even looking at the comments here, it's the same styles and brands being recommended. it's unfortunate",2025-04-16 02:30:57

fzctungkun,speedmaster,"i already own the speedmaster moonwatch and i’ve been thinking about my next omega. the white dial moonwatch has certainly caught my eye, but for the current city i live in there is only one retailer and the watch is in such high demand that they don’t know when they would be able to get one, and i was hesitating whether i should spend money on the exact same specs with a different color dial. then omega surprised us with the pilot in october 2024 and i was instantly attracted. the retailer was able to get one allocated last month and invited me to try it out. after a few try i decided to bite the bullet and get it.

 

things i like

\-all the usual goodies of omega: co-axial movement, metas certified master chronometer, superb anti-magnetic level

\-very cool dial design and color profile paying homage to the vintage pilot watch, triple colors in the 9 o’clock small seconds dial, the red hands in the 3 o’clock chronograph minutes and hour dial, and the plane-shaped chronograph seconds hand, totally oozing that aviation instrument board vibe

\-as usual, chronograph operations are crispy and precise

\-legibility is also superb as everything contrasts well with the matt finish black dial

\-generous portion of lamination materials on the hour indicators and the main minute and hour hands

\-steel bracelet wears comfortable, and the brushed dull-edge center links make it less inclined to clip wrist hairs compared to the moonwatch bracelet

\-comes with travel pouch, an additional set of straps, and spring bar changing tool

 

concerns/attention needed

\-thick (official 14.7mm, my measurement is about 14.8mm with the crystal bulge), heavy, this watch will make its presence felt at all times

\-sinc the watch prioritizes changing hour hands according to time zone quickly, there is no quick date adjustments; date must be changed by rotating the hour hand

\-wish there were lumes on the chronograph second, minute, and hour hands to help time counting in darkness

\-price level is certainly a point of contention",2025-04-14 22:30:51

serge_cell,speedmaster,"each has pro and cons (mostly concerning movements):


speedy: 


cons: the only one of the set here without vertical clutch, but that is by necessity, because movement despite some updates is mostly developed for historical and cosmetic value. luck of vertical clutch means chrono seconds hand may jump a little at the start.


pro: historical and most beautiful movement out of the set. high accuracy. easy to monitor movement condition, with high x loupe you can even check lubrication level. great bracelet.  manual winding (too long to explain why manual winding is  often preferable for mechanical watch). the watch is on my to-buy que.


speedmaster '57


cons: date without fast date switch. you have to rotate hours hand all the way 24 hours for each day to set the date (in pseudo-gmt mode). some watchmakers complain that create addition wear on the movement. huge bridge cover most of movement with only balance and column wheel opened.

pro: vertical clutch. high accuracy. dual barrel -  that feature provide cheaper version of ""constant force"" usually found only in high horology peaces. means accuracy less affected by mainspring unwinding.  pseudo-gmt - hours hand is jump-rotated with crown in position 2, great for changing daylight saving time and time zones. despite some people saying opposite in my opinion two-counters provide better legibility then traditional tricompax layout. nice finishing of the movement bridge. manual winding. i have automatic version and like it a lot, no fast date is the only drawback.


tag:


cons: tear-down videos hint the movement is less robust then omega. automatic without ""constant force"" mechanism, means at low power watch may lose accuracy. no historical value, less bragging rights ;)


pro: vertical clutch. much cheaper then omega. great daily beater. th20 movement should have improved accuracy and bidirectional rotor. dial look very good for price point.",2025-03-29 06:11:01

what do you like about each of them? interesting that you picked 2 chronos and one diver...any reason? 

the oris, in build quality will definitely be less than the omega and i assume the iwc (i have owned an oris, own several omegas - i'm a self proclaimed omega fanboy fwiw ) but haven't owned any iwcs as they don't do it for me, personally. 

for me, i've learned i'm big on applied indices and markers and don't like the flatness that a printed dial brings, so for those reasons the iwc would be out (and why i don't appreciate the majority of their lineup), but ymmv on that. 

as much as i love omega, the one you selected is not the watch imo if you want to have ""one nice watch."" it isn't versatile and as someone earlier said that's a watch for someone with a large collection: i just bought a ceramic seamaster black black and it's stealthy af and i love the way omega does ceramics. omega also makes other ceramic speed masters that are more legible (my cousin has one and it's his favorite watch). 

if your budget allows for something in the ceramic omega or iwc price point then go for it, the oris is nice, but it's a different thing. if you're tied to iwc because of your history with your dad then do that. definitely see them in person if you can, or look at videos of them and real life pics, not just company website renders: how watches play with light because of textures and finishing (polished surfaces, radial and otherwise) is something to behold and almost study.",2025-03-26 02:25:45

RedditJw2019,seamaster,"i agree rolex has a timeless design (particularly the sub). i think the sub serves as an excellent daily watch that stands up to wear, and the black sub is less of a statement piece. it goes with anything. 

  
there is a big price difference, and if you get the smp 300 at market price (not retail price), i do think the sub is twice or more the cost. 

  
i've had several seamasters and currently still have 3 (skyfall at, nttd, and smp 300). i previously had a black smp purchased 15 years ago, and then sold it for the smp 300 a few years ago. the smp design was getting ""dated"" imo, especially the bracelet. and i feel that one day, i will feel the same about the smp 300. it's not as elegant or timeless as a sub. but it's a great watch and a good deal relative to the sub. 

  
if you are willing to wait a little, i imagine the wait for a new sub isnt that bad these days. i think it all depends on what the sales person makes of you. if you are entitled and an ass, you might be on waitlist forever. but if you catch them on a good day, and you are a nice friendly chap, you might get the call that day if they just got one in. 

  
regardless of the hype, i feel like the sub is such a timeless and versatile piece. if i could only keep one watch to wear forever, it would likely be the sub. i dont care what others hype or not.",2025-03-11 12:26:19

byudzai2,aqua terra,"oh man....  this has been the journey for 20 years now.

omega smp, 2006, my one watch for about three years.

buuuuuut....  then i went on a spree. couldn't afford anything but still somehow got into an iwc vintage ingenieur, a blancpain big date, an omega aqua terra pga edition.

the aqua terra was the one watch for about three years. then another spree, the deville hourvision in blue, a chonker planet ocean, and then a rolex exp 1, 39mm.

the explorer became the one watch for about three years. then i got into nomos and had a few of those pieces. eventually sold a bunch of other watches, including the rolex which now languished unloved in a drawer, to buy a guitar.

got a nomos neomatik club sport date and that was a serious one watch, solid three years. it was a terrific one watch: bold, simple, playful, heaps of lume, gorgeous dial design. buuuuuuut....

these last few years have been savage, brutal bloodshed. i think it started by stumbling onto js watch in iceland, picked up a couple pieces. then got a sarpaneva nakki harvest moon, utter grail watch, kept shit time and despite three service returns it still died after wearing it for 3-4 days. returned that. i now have an absurd collection and love all of them. couple more incoming.

i did just get a jack mason pursuit anniversary edition. it's keeping shit time so far, -10/day, and so far their customer service is garbage, but the watch itself is a strong contender for a one watch. the dial is a rip from the iwc mk xvi and, thus, super legible. the cnc lumed indices add depth and glow like nuclear waste. tidy size at 39mm. great case architexture, reminds me of the aqua terra. classy but not douchey. adjustable clasp. good crown. if they ever reply to my email, and if they regulate it into spec, it'll probably be my one watch for a good while.

meanwhile i have the purple-dialed venezianico coming and the blue-dialed little wonder from zealandic. a one watch needs to be on a bracelet so it can fit into any environment, so neither of those will seize the throne, but gosh they're gorgeous.

i still want a sarpaneva one day, but i don't trust their qc anymore.

Dshin525,speedmaster,"i've been collecting for 20+ yrs and probably owned 60+ watches in that time. i usually had around 5-10 watches at a given time. i owned many of the big/luxury brands (rolex, omega, jlc, iwc, zenith, panerai). then last year i decided that i just wanted to have one really nice watch that i can wear anywhere. so i sold most of my watches that i owned at the time (rolex 16710 pepsi, rolex 16600 seadweller, omega seamaster 300 heritage, iwc spitfire, jlc master compressor geographic) and got the vacheron constantin 7900v dual time...and i haven't looked back. 

when i had a larger collection, i would find myself wearing one or 2 exclusively and the rest would just sit for weeks (or even months). whenever i added a new watch, i would wear it for a couple weeks and once the honeymoon period was over, it would sit with the others.  

so for me i'd rather have that one really nice watch than a collection. however, had i not had the experience of owning a large variety of watches i probably would feel differently.

Dshin525,seamaster,"i've been collecting for 20+ yrs and probably owned 60+ watches in that time. i usually had around 5-10 watches at a given time. i owned many of the big/luxury brands (rolex, omega, jlc, iwc, zenith, panerai). then last year i decided that i just wanted to have one really nice watch that i can wear anywhere. so i sold most of my watches that i owned at the time (rolex 16710 pepsi, rolex 16600 seadweller, omega seamaster 300 heritage, iwc spitfire, jlc master compressor geographic) and got the vacheron constantin 7900v dual time...and i haven't looked back. 

when i had a larger collection, i would find myself wearing one or 2 exclusively and the rest would just sit for weeks (or even months). whenever i added a new watch, i would wear it for a couple weeks and once the honeymoon period was over, it would sit with the others.  

so for me i'd rather have that one really nice watch than a collection. however, had i not had the experience of owning a large variety of watches i probably would feel differently.

themadnader,speedmaster,"crystal durability is an interesting and somewhat nuanced question.  neither of my moonswatches have any scratches on them, but i also have a moderately large watch collection (>20 in my ""regular rotation), so it doesn't get worn that often (though not really less than most of my watches).

no doubt sapphire will give you better scratch resistance, but i'd argue that on a watch as slender and low profile as the moonswatch impact rather than scratch resistance might be the bigger risk and sapphire being more rigid has generally worse impact resistance than hesalite, mineral, or poly crystals like on the moonswatch.

it's also super easy to buff out a scratch on a mineral crystal with some polywatch- not so much on sapphire; i don't think i'd let that deter me from getting one.  i do think you'll want to wear it first, because it is exceedingly light and may not feel ""substantial"" enough for for you, and i personally prefer mechanical watches (for a variety of reasons).

in my opinion there was a bunch of hype around the moonswatch, which drew in lots of people who don't really appreciate or understand what they were getting.  they're great, reliable, swiss watches with the timeless, iconic design and omega stamp of a speedmaster...but they're not comparable to a true speedy, which would be ridiculous to expect on a sub-$300 watch, yet i think that irked people who stood in line for days or paid $1k or more for one (which is madness).",2025-02-25 19:19:19

another thing i really like about the tudor is that it is a watch that whispers but doesn’t shout as much as an omega and usually goes more under the radar from the most which is something i value a lot.

if someone were to go and resell it, they'd probably be pissed the watch they paid 500 bucks for would probably resell for less then $100.

and if you want me to explain why an omega speedmaster (which can take a month to build and weeks to test) isn't the same as a mass produced plastic swatch stamped with an omega emblem, that's what common sense is for brother.

on the one hand, extracting the movement and dial will aiui entail pretty much destroying the original case.  now, that ""bioceramic"" case might not be that great in the grand scheme of things, but it is very much part of what makes a moonswatch a moonswatch.  putting the movement and dial in a different case gets you… something which is neither a moonswatch nor a speedmaster professional.

on the other hand, if you want something with a stainless steel case that is neither a moonswatch nor a speedy, then there are lots of affordable speedy homages that look _more_ like a real moonwatch for less than you paid for this swatch.  most have either a seiko vk63 mechaquartz movement or a seagull st19 manual-wind, either of which will give you a proper mechanical ""click"" on the pushers and a smoother sweep on the chrono seconds hand.",2025-02-17 13:12:16

crikcet37,speedmaster,"this is a lovely watch. 

i bought this watch around 6 months ago and i was very pleased with the purchase when it arrived at my door. i have owned a couple of omegas over the years and they have all been a pleasure to own so when i came into a little bit of money from a pension rebate i decided to pick up a speedmaster. 

this 2010 speedmaster date is a 40mm automatic chronograph using the eta/valjoux 7750 movement, it's the most affordable speedmaster you can buy right now which is one of the reasons why i bought it but to hold and to wear you can tell it's a very well made wristwatch. actuating the pushers is really satisfying and i love the rotor wobble when you sharply move your wrist, it feels like an apple watch buzzing on your wrist. the dial is superb and that 40mm size with a steel bracelet is, for me, the perfect size.

for some reason i cannot fathom i do not love this watch. i like it and wear it occasionally but i almost force myself to wear it because of how much i paid for it. i really thought i'd love this thing but it hasn't gelled with me at all so i'm going to move it on and put the money towards something else. such a shame but you can't keep flogging a dead horse so it's got to go.

aznj1m,speedmaster,"hi all -

the speedmaster was the first watch i got when i started this hobby back in 2017. my friend who was way more knowledgeable than me told me that it is the best first - and arguably as a one and done as well - watch anyone could get.

the 1861 speedmaster was rest but always felt a bit too big for me as much as i wanted to try to love it.

i sold that to switch the speedy ‘57 60th anniversary on the left and it was a great versatile chronograph and tipped the hat to the pre-moon days with the broad arrow and smaller case.

the 3861 speedmaster to me is the best speedmaster produced with a modern and comfortable bracketed - the weakest point in protons editions of the speedmaster imo - and only made even more eye catching with the white dial.

to celebrate a milestone, i was lucky enough to snag. 321 ed white speedmaster after reading up a ton about it. i did co sided a daytona but the ed white speedmaster really is something a little more special and personal than what a daytona does for me.

while keeping similar design features as the professional model, the 321 really feels like a higher quality time piece in the ballpark of langes and some pateks versus a more tool-watch inspired feeling the 3861 has. the movement showcased in the back  is also rad and something i wish rolex did more of.

so if i could pick one - probably the black 3861 speedy. easily wearable and the best version of a speedy made to date. but if you can have options….",2025-02-03 18:11:32

for a different kind of pick, the christopher ward the twelve, has a integrated bracelet design with a textured dial. i know the watch is more reminiscent of the czapek antartique, but the indices always remind of the aqua terra.

the tissot gentleman also strangely fits the bill for me as an affordable alternative. the alternating brushed and polished surfaces on the dial and bracelet along with the more muted dials remind me of the aqua terra.

Soul_XCV,aqua terra,"the omega looks perfect for everyday wear. if you wanna dress it down even further, get a rubber strap. buy it in the bracelet and get a rubber strap from omega themselves, or an aftermarket one. a lot of stores make exact copies of the same one omega sells. also imo, if this is the 41mm, get the 38mm.

also, please let your thoughts simmer for a few weeks to a month or even a few months for now before pulling the trigger. you seem very indecisive right now and letting first impressions of these pieces and the opinions of random strangers on reddit sway your decision to a watch which you may end up not liking in the long term.

pros: vintage motorsport vibes with a fresh twist, bold colorways, great wrist presence without being bulky.
cons: may be too loud for more conservative or daily settings depending on the dial.

bremont mb meteor
pros: unique british heritage piece, super lightweight with the titanium build, and the meteor dial adds character.
cons: bremont case size can feel large on smaller wrists. resale isn’t as strong as some of the others.

pros: clean design, understated tool watch energy, solid movement and great finishing.
cons: can feel a little sterile to some, and no display caseback like you mentioned.

phoenixaki,seamaster,"i recently had a similar conundrum as i was contemplating getting the no date sub. i didn't and ended up getting a santos xl chrono. now both are very different watches so it's not an apples to apples comparison. having said that, the part that what made me reject the sub was when i tried it on. it felt boring, plain and lifeless. it lacked any sort of personality, atleast for me. 

so i'd recommend you try on both and see what speaks to you and your personality the best. rolex is just another mid tier mass manufactured luxury watch like omega so quality wise it's all the same. if the sub speaks to you more, go for it. if the seamaster is more to your style, go for that. either ways, they're both well made watches!",2025-05-03 10:11:38

Big_Entertainer3610,seamaster,"i actually tried on both and still can’t decide. the sub feels timeless and iconic, but honestly, it’s everywhere. the seamaster feels more under the radar, which i like, but sometimes i get the “too poor for a rolex” vibe from it. it’s tough when both have strong pros and cons",2025-05-03 10:15:41
Big_Entertainer3610,seamaster,"fair point, you’re right that both are luxury purchases, and if i’m already in that price rang. i think i just got caught up in the image and hype that surrounds rolex. but honestly, the seamaster does feel more like me, less flashy, more character. your comment helped me see that a bit more clearly. appreciate the honesty.",2025-05-03 10:28:41

* omega aqua terra is just too thick for what it is.
* most grand seikos have too much polishing for me, i would prefer some matte surfaces. additionally, the power reserve complication is not aligned with anything and looks out of place.
* tudor ranger has some issues with the the sizing and spacing of the numerals, also the printed dial is just a bad look on such an expensive watch. i understand that there are really expensive watches with printed dials but the ranger looks like a gas station watch.
* i wish longines would update the numerals on their non-gmt hydro conquest, they look too cartoonish.
* iwc spittfire has 50mm lugs on a 39mm case, also reports of their qc/warranty services keeps me away.

KCDawgTime,aqua terra,"well, truthfully, it's all very subjective. 

that said, watches with bezels are generally considered tool watches. as such, it's a bit harder to consider them ""proper"" wear for an after hours dinner and drinks. a watch with no bezel, like some aqua terras, doesn't have a bezel but does have to water resistance and toughness allowing it to be used as a tool or a dinner companion.

first, this is subjective, but has generally been accepted by many enthusiasts.  second, james bond is not a real person,. third, even if he was, most of us don't have the looks or charm of him or his alter-ego sean connery does and are therefore not cool enough to pull it off.

movies are ofthen what make styles more popular and normalise them. think of james dean from a rebel without a cause, before that movie wearing t shirts was considered an undergarment. same thing happened with wearing dive watches with suits thanks to james bond that's more what i meant. 

also the other way, wearing a dress watch now can work with a casual outfit. when before it would never be accepted. 

yeah ofc, if you like it wear it. it's all about how you feel wearing it. though overall i still agree with you, just that i find the added functionality of a dive bezel is more useful as a gada than something that could work a little better in a dressy scenario without a dive bezel. for me, i still own a more dressy watch (a vintage seamaster with the metal bracelet). and occasions where i need to dress up are virtually nonexistent, or a seamaster would be more than acceptable.",2025-04-11 19:23:36

mustangpirate,aqua terra,"as far as the grand seikos dealer giving you those “tips” on activities to avoid. those are things that you should avoid with any of the watches from these brands. i would argue that they are playing it safe but any thing that would cause problems on gs watches would likely cause problems on the other mentioned brands. 

working around heavy metal machinery is likely to cause scratches and activities like guns and golf have been known to cause problems. 

ad experience is usually worst with rolex (also ap and patek) they can treat customers this way because the brand has luxury status beyond just people actually interested in a watch, they’ve become status symbols. 

grand seiko, omega, and breitling have been ime easier to work with because they don’t have random crypto bros and of models just buying things to fit in with their friends.

panthere is great choice. there are so many tank options with various sizes and colors and metals. i also really like tortue case but often run too much $. also check out the aqua terra line especially the 34mm. longines has some nice options at a fewer lower price tiers as well.

Valuable-Ad7285,aqua terra,i would like at the omega aqua terra shades collection. they have a gorgeous champagne dial similar to the longines.,2025-03-18 08:16:57
SasuketwR,aqua terra,"the longines is an amazing watch for the price, with a discount it can be found for around 1800 euros brand new. that's what i paid for my old blue one. an aqua terra costs over double the price. you could purchase the longines as well and add another watch on top such as an oris diver or sinn 356 chronograph for the same price.

the at is the superior watch in every way, better movement, finishing, dimensions (shorter lug to lug), bracelet and strap versatility. but it should be given that it is double the price. if i am not mistaken you can even put the newer 38mm at bracelet on this model.

if money isn't an object, you really love it or if you are aiming for a higher end watch collection: get the aqua terra. in other scenarios the longines offers an excellent value proposition.",2025-03-18 08:21:23

but you've encouraged me to consider something other than my 'safe & boring' choices. and i like the way you've mixed up straps to give the collection some breadth. 

change one? maybe swap the oris for a more formal microbrand, like the salmon dial baltic?

shadoww_17,seamaster,"i finally got my hands on a beautiful seamaster aqua terra co axial chronometer, and boy is it lovely.

the seamaster aqua terra has always intrigued me, i'm not a huge fan of the smp for the helium escape valve, and collecting primarily vintage watches i've been drawn to watches of smaller stature (and admittedly, a touch more dressy leaning). i feel like this 38.5mm is pushing the upper edge of watches i can wear on my 6.5"" wrist without them looking out of place.

the aqua terra seems to do it all, and in my opinion is a perfect gada. it's incredibly versatile, dressy enough to not look out of place in a formal setting and tough enough for the day to day. 

i have to admit, i am so glad that this model does not feature polished middle links, those are something i cannot stand. 

not to mention, the 8500 is absolutely gorgeous to look at and is equally interesting mechanically with the completely alien co-axial escapement.

Sbar267,seamaster,"hello guys

alright buckle up..yep, this is one of those « size » posts. but one with a twist 😂

so, i want a seamaster diver, and nothing else.

i have a small wrist (between 6.2 and 6.4inch or 16 and 16.5cm)

first step of course was window shopping on omega's website for days, and my heart went for the green model.

but, i have a small wrist.

so i went on and tried a 36mm vintage seamaster. - first picture

while the fit was just fine, i did not like the proportions and the look in real life. it felt distorted due to the small dial.

i then went ahead and tried on a 41mm vintage black seamaster (aluminum dial). - second picture

i liked it.

then, being more and more confident, i went ahead and tried the 42mm current ceramic model (heart choice : green and gorgeous versatility : black). i like it a lot. it feels more premium and juste nicer. (latest pictures)

now the 41mm feels underwhelming and associated with big fomo (« i could have gotten the better one »)

but, i am still afraid the 42mm is « too much » as in « too big ».

\- what do you guys think? is the 42mm too big?

many thanks in advance",2025-02-28 16:19:53
KCDawgTime,seamaster,"first, can you drive? if so, there are at least six authorized dealers and one omega boutique in chicago an hour and a half away from you. find the closest one, and you are in business.

second, there are a lot of things to unpack when looking at those two brands and model types. the seamaster is not an entry level watch. new from a retailer, i believe they start out around $5,900. tag heuer, however, has a number of models ranging from quartz ars that start around $2k to solar ars that run around $2.5k to $4k for their professional line of solar and automatics. of course all, including omega, can be found for less on jomashop.

so, it's really a matter of what you want to spend and what kind of movement you are good with. you are close enough for tag heuer or omega dealers - or can mail your watch off - should you have a problem. both brands are good, and i would posit that though more watch enthusiasts will recognize and like the omega, more people up and down the street will recognize the tag heuer. both are great brands, so buy what you like and can afford.

tupaquetes,aqua terra,"posting the text here as well just in case :   
  
a week ago i weighed myself and was delighted to have passed a huge milestone : **after losing 91 lbs, i am no longer obese !** i wanted to celebrate this with a watch and figured a nice symbol would be to get a thin and small watch i could wear on pretty much any occasion to remind me of the accomplishment. also i'm from france so a french brand felt appropriate. my other choice would have been a traska commuter in adriatic blue but it's not available at this time and i'm worried about returns buying a watch from the us after seeing quite a few posts about qc issues online.

i realize 37mm isn't a particularly small watch but i started with 41mm watches so this actually feels like a pretty big step down from what i'm used to, and i have to say it feels great on the wrist and now my 41mm propilot seems huge (in no small part due to my wrist shrinking with the lost weight)... it's actually making me rethink a lot of my ""grail watches"". i had planned to celebrate reaching goal weight (which is still \~40lbs away) with (depending on the available budget) a nomos metro update, an aqua terra with the orange seconds hand, or a tudor black bay chrono, all of them in 41mm. it's okay though, i've got some time to think about alternatives !

a bit more on the watch itself :

obviously it's very pretty. the 3d lume indexes, the circular stainless steel ring under them, the domed crystal and shiny bezel all make for great light play and depth on the dial. i bought it with the beads of rice bracelet as well but honestly it just looks better on the rubber strap.

it feels great on the wrist, the watch is very thin (10.8mm, only 8.3 without the sapphire) and light and sits very flat. the fkm rubber strap has just the right amount of stiffness, however the holes are quite far apart and the buckle side is a tad short, the buckle doesn't sit all that close to the middle of my 17cm/6.7"" wrist.

the movement is great. it's not my first miyota 9 series, they're super thin, relatively easy to regulate and the noisy rotor is easy to fix with the right grease. after regulating it i set the time 5 days ago and it's only 3 seconds fast right now. and after using some molykote dx grease on the rotor it is absolutely inaudible unless you shake it right next to your ear.

having such a precise movement (once regulated) on a gada-style watch largely negates the disadvantages of the integrated crown which, yes, is a tad annoying to wind and pull out. but it's an automatic, just shake it a few times, use a fingernail to pull the crown out to set the time and you're good to go. or just put it on a watch winder.",2025-04-30 13:18:00

SEND_ME_YOUR_HENTAI,seamaster,"couple of important things here. 

you want a daily driver, but what are you typically doing on an average day?
an at is very versatile, but i personally feel like the snowflake can get near the sportiness but absolutely outdress it on average. if you have an office job, i think the gs or at is the winner. if your day to day sees a lot of exposure to water, go for the seamaster 300m. yes, it's true, for most people, the watches will never see more than a sink's exposure for water, but still.

if you care at all about movements, the gs defeats either omega in my opinion. the spring drive has such smooth motion, no real ticking, more of a glide.

in terms of toughness, i don't think the gs is going to beat omega, so if you find yourself doing that kind of thing, omega is good.

more important, what size is your wrist? i've seen a few fellows whose wrists are relatively small, and the 300m looks like a monster on their wrist. the gs runs smaller though.",2025-04-26 03:44:25

Screaming_Bald_Eagle,aqua terra,"hi all, been a recent lurker to the sub and will say am hooked. i was looking for a gada watch and sort of landed on the omega aqua terra . now the question is should i go with 41 or the 38.

for context, the watches i currently own (two cheaper pieces and a bulova 96b311) are all in the 44–45mm range, so i’m used to a larger presence on the wrist. that said, i keep seeing people hype up the 38mm aqua terra, and it has me wondering — would that size feel too small, or is it actually the sweet spot?

i’d also appreciate opinions on the bulova wrist presence , i don’t feel it’s big , but i’m sure there are people with keener eye than me on this sub. that would help in narrowing down the choice.

appreciate all the help , looking forward to reading the responses",2025-04-18 18:34:44
JollyGreen_,speedmaster,"an example. i went to try on a speedmaster the price was $8k. the tariff notifications went out and omega ads were sent the new sticker prices for all their goods, then the tariffs were delayed 90days. i went back to speak to the rolex ad a week later and stopped by omega again, that same speedmaster was under $7k as omega is trying to dump as many watches as possible before the tariffs. that would be an example of “good timing” and trends to follow when practicing smart spending. there was a good time, and a bad time to purchase there in that example. and one could have learned which was which of patient and paying attention. 

i’m not saying you’re wrong, but i’m not a financial or trading expert, i’m just some guy who likes cool watches and likes to save a buck where i can. if i can get more “insider info” about such trends then that’s all i’m trying to do. save a few bucks where i can.

you've got 2 aqua terras and 2 grand seikos that feel a bit repetitive despite being different colors or even having different complications. grand seiko is just kinda like that in general since they really have a lot of watches with a very similar overall presentation despite a lot of details being different on paper. and having literally 2 of the same model in the aqua terra is obviously going to feel repetitive.

you seem to like color and interesting details, so my first thought is to get rid of the longines or the black aqua terra. i'm leaning towards getting rid of the longines just because it feels the most out of place in the lineup.

if i could break your rules a bit, i'd actually get rid of the longines, the white grand seiko that's *not* the dressy case, *and* the black aqua terra. that leaves you with a nice collection of 2 really interesting dress watches (constellation and omiwatari), 2 really interesting more casual everyday watches (gs gmt and red aqua terra), and a fairly neutral dial datejust which can basically go with anything.

maybe take the money from those sales and get something a bit off your current script like a chronograph and really lean into the sporty look you only are dipping your toes into right now. those new tag heurer glassbox carreras are really cool and come in some crazy colors so that would actually kind of fit what you seem to like despite being a new complication. or just buy more of what you obviously like which is interesting details on relatively simple watches with a bit of color. i dunno... maybe an integrated bracelet watch in a bold configuration.",2025-03-05 17:09:07

i knew i wanted this, since the moment i learned of the existence of a sporty omega aqua terra, but without the polished links on the bracelet. this just seems to hit all the marks (and yeah, i like that it has the whole 'skyfall' story to it as well).

i wear it almost daily, for activities such as swimming and running or hiking. i don't wear it to work, as i m not allowed to wear watches or jewellery etc.

spikecurtis,aqua terra,"i have that specific aqua terra and a different grand seiko (sbgx355) with the same movement as the sbgx261.

i’ll start by saying i think they’re both great choices.

the grand seiko has a nicer movement. the 9f hits all the indexes perfectly, and does 2 impulses per tick so that visually, it gracefully snaps to the next index without any “thrash.” the aqua terra seconds hand looks a bit sloppy by comparison: it doesn’t consistently land over the seconds indexes and has some visual thrash. it’s the kind of thing that is really only noticeable in comparison; if you’re not looking for it the aqua terra just looks like a normal quartz watch ticking away. one thing the aqua terra movement has going for it is a quickset hour feature, so it’s easy to switch time zones or deal with daylight savings. nice to have if you travel often but not essential.

i really like the aqua terra case design: the omega “lyre” lugs look great. it’s a bit more restrained than the grand seiko, with mostly brushed surfaces. grand seiko is of course known for “zaratsu” polish—but the sbgx261 is also relatively toned down, avoiding the big mirrored surfaces of the 44gs case. honestly both cases look great.

i like the handset on the aqua terra better. they’re not as nicely finished as the grand seiko, but have more personality. that’s probably a good overall summary of how i feel about the two watches.

i like the aqua terra bracelet just a little bit better. both are fold-over with a push-button release. neither has micro-adjustments, and neither have a big bulky clasp, which is just how i like it. the aqua terra bracelet fold-over is pressed steel, which doesn’t look as premium as the milled grand seiko, but it has a little telescopic bit that allows it to be physically shorter and therefore wear nicer. i’ve had the omega bracelet accidentally pop open once or twice, so i’d call the grand seiko design more secure.",2025-01-21 14:25:52
Calm_Lake6288,aqua terra,"thank you for the comprehensive response and insights. i haven’t seen the aqua terra in person, which makes the decision significantly harder.

i think i’m leaning towards the gs. its advantages include:

* a brand-new watch (i get to scratch it myself)
* 5-year warranty
* superior movement
* my partner prefers it
* i don’t know anyone who owns a grand seiko
* handcrafted
* exceptional finishing

the aqua terra’s advantages are:

* iconic watch (at least in my opinion)
* more going on with the dial (though i’m not sure if this is a pro or a con)
* better logo—i’m not a fan of the gs logo.

the japanese excel at creating incredible things with meticulous attention to detail, but i don’t think they’re as skilled when it comes to marketing and branding. in my view, gs needs a stronger, more distinctive brand and story. they could also improve their naming conventions. :)

the gs clearly has more advantages, so i think it’s the winner.",2025-01-22 07:17:05

Dr_Omega24,aqua terra,"you have a lot of options at that price range but for me the question is where this sits in the context of a collection. 

are you making advancements in your collection with a focus on complications, dial, prestige, heritage, engineering, something else? 

grand seiko spring drive is a big diversion in many collections that incorporates unique beauty and engineering while a jlc is a big step up in prestige and watchmaking technicality in the most traditional sense. omega, to me at least, in almost all models is very much a cornerstone or anchor in a collection (i'm particularly taken by the new aqua terra in a polished black lacquer currently). 

it's not an answer but hopefully some questions that will help you get to an answer.",2025-01-15 22:44:03
Msimanyi,seamaster,"i'm wearing the slga019 right now, having bought it in august.  it is stunning in person and really didn't impress me in photos and reviews.  i understand the 021 appears much darker in person and basically looks black most of the time.  the 019 looks as dark as that 021 image on my screen, and itself looks black in a lot of lighting conditions.  when it pops blue though, it's blue!  

the 019 is also titanium.  i happen to love that and feel that it's almost effortless on the wrist, so just for that factor alone would prefer it if choosing between the two, but if you're not interested in titanium, i understand.  

your gs option would likely be my top choice as (a) it is under the radar to most people (b) all the details are stunningly beautiful and (c) the spring drive mechanism is mesmerizing and incredibly accurate.  i set mine at the time change on november 5th, and it's less than 0.5 seconds off as of last weekend.  (it's barely more than 0.25 seconds off, so i rounded up.)

my #2 would be the jlc.  that master ultra thin date blue is really, really cool.  it's an uncommon shade of blue.   if you're looking for a dress watch, that would be my #1 choice.  i also like the moon version, which is a brighter blue.  either is great for a dressy watch.

i happen to loooooove the seamaster black lacquer, but once getting away from that dial i'd stick with one of your other options.  i do love both the yellow and orange options too though.

big piece of advice: put them all on your wrist before deciding.  do it over a couple weekends and really consider this carefully.  do not buy them sight unseen.  

i wasn't in the market for a watch when i bought my gs.  a buddy was checking them out and i just went along for the experience.  they happened to have the 019 in their display case and when i put it on my wrist... it just pressed all the right buttons.  even so, i went home and thought about it further, then returned the next weekend and asked to see it in natural light at the front of the store.  (store lights tend to really overstate the beauty of watch details.)  since i own it now, you can see how that went...

by the way, if you're in southern california the hyde park / 1916 store in fashion island has a really good selection to check out.",2025-01-15 23:28:22

crusader_____,aqua terra,personally i think the blue 36 mm oyster perpetual is nice. certain versions of the blue datejust can also be found under 10k. i’d say that have a much better wearing experience than the aqua terra,2025-01-15 23:12:56
FormerCollegeDJ,aqua terra,"take a look at the blue dial version of the omega constellation globemaster (39 mm width).  imo, that’s a truly stunning watch (and one of my future targets), much nicer looking than any of the aqua terra series watches.

if you don’t go in that direction, a grand seiko is usually a good choice.  (i personally own the snowflake, aka sbga211.)

i have one more left field, under the radar choice - the citizen aq4091-56m (40 mm width).  don’t be thrown off by “citizen” - the citizen line is largely analogous to grand seiko with seiko (though the citizen is a line rather than a separate company.)  the aq4091-56m is a highly polished, high accuracy quartz, indigo dial watch accurate to 5 seconds/year with regular wear.  it costs a good bit less than your price range ($2500 to $3000), and you’ll also need to buy it from (or in) japan.  but that watch, also one of my future targets, is a stunner.  (there is also a blue dial variant, the aq4091-56l, but i think the indigo dial version looks better.)",2025-01-16 00:46:32

i’ll admit the prx i’ve had to learn to love since the lug to lug on paper was quite compact but in reality you really need to factor in the first links i’ve since learnt on an integrated bracelet which is why it looks bigger.

Goodvib3sonly,aqua terra,"does the aqua terra (38 mm - 1st picture) look better on me than the 41 mm version (2nd picture)? i have an explorer (36 mm), aqua terra (41 mm) and a jlc ultra thin moon (39 mm) and am wondering if i should change the at to 38 mm. i've been thinking about it for a couple of years but i don't know if i should as the at at 38 mm seems dainty to me at time and the at should be a sporty watch (at least to me)!",2025-01-03 12:01:43
ManagementOk3164,seamaster,well i think it looks dainty to you because you’re not used to it. 38 definitely looks classier. the seamaster is already sporty by not being a rectangular white dial watch on a leather strap. don’t let others fool you: 41 isn’t a classy look with this watch.,2025-01-03 12:28:16
Crispster,aqua terra,is the wearing experience more uncomfortable on the 41mm? cause from the looks of both 38 and 41mm they look great on your wrist. but! if it is more comfortable on the 38 i would value that over the movement. personally it would bug me to hell that i can’t have both and it’ll be a twinge whenever i wear it. which is why i haven’t gotten an aqua terra. too thick for my personal taste.,2025-01-04 09:30:25
Zamboni4201,aqua terra,"as someone else suggested, i second the iwc mark xx.  blue or green have stunning dials.  bracelet is super comfortable with an adjust-on-the-fly clasp, and a great mix of brushed and polished.  quick change to the oem leather… and if you’re good, you can get the ad to throw in the leather.  can also go black dial or white dial too.  i have the blue.  

any tudor black bay would be a bit more subtle, all-brushed, bezel or no bezel depending on your taste.  black bay’s are also versatile.  any strap imaginable looks good.  i have several bb’s.  

aqua terra is on par with the iwc, nice mix of polished and brushed.  

explorer is good, and resale if you get sick of it is likely better than anything else, but they have dropped a bit in the past 3 years.  

good luck.",2024-12-30 01:19:05
Msimanyi,aqua terra,"if you can get it in time, i'd do the explorer.  

but if you can't, i encourage you to check out the aqua terra black lacquer in person.  it's gorgeous, and i really don't think it stands out any more than the explorer.

i'll link [this too](https://www.jaeger-lecoultre.com/us-en/watches/master-control/master-control-date-stainless-steel-q4018420), but (a) you'd probably need a black strap for it for the wedding and (b) it's considerably more expensive than the explorer, much less the at:

# omega adds a gradient turquoise dial to the seamaster aqua terra 150m shades collection

omega doesn’t participate in an official manner in any of the big watch shows where most brands release a bunch of models all at once. that means that they then take a few key weeks in the year and reveal pretty much everything. but it’s usually all within one week. with this being an olympic year which saw them introduce a whole bunch of new models dedicated to the olympic games, this meant that a lot of their other releases were pushed towards the latter part of the year. and what a few weeks it’s been. first, there was the [no-date seamaster diver 300m duo](https://www.itsabouttime.email/p/omega-launches-seamaster-diver-300m-no-date-serica-has-a-radically-different-dress-watch-brellum-shr?utm_source=www.itsabouttime.email&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=omega-adds-gradient-turquoise-dial-to-seamaster-aqua-terra-vulcain-teams-up-with-massena-lab-for-a-sensational-nautical-brew-s-new-take-on-the-metric-urwerk-has-a-new-ur-230-in-white-ceramic&_bhlid=419b5f15c0b4104ab12ad9ba09d1aa23d719f5f5), followed by the [same watch in green and bronze](https://www.itsabouttime.email/p/omega-releases-titanium-bronze-gold-green-dial-seamaster-no-date-baltic-adds-bronze-to-herme-tique-t?utm_source=www.itsabouttime.email&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=omega-adds-gradient-turquoise-dial-to-seamaster-aqua-terra-vulcain-teams-up-with-massena-lab-for-a-sensational-nautical-brew-s-new-take-on-the-metric-urwerk-has-a-new-ur-230-in-white-ceramic&_bhlid=2d634bb46328388c0cce6645630252a5e9b9a6c0), only to top out with the [spectacular speedmaster pilot](https://www.itsabouttime.email/p/omega-makes-the-very-cool-speedmaster-pilot-a-reality-breitling-releases-caribbean-duo-marloe-update?utm_source=www.itsabouttime.email&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=omega-adds-gradient-turquoise-dial-to-seamaster-aqua-terra-vulcain-teams-up-with-massena-lab-for-a-sensational-nautical-brew-s-new-take-on-the-metric-urwerk-has-a-new-ur-230-in-white-ceramic&_bhlid=e7d68c83b946d0c3f963468757f8659e570f7ee3). well, there was one more release (hopefully the last one this year — i love you omega, but chill…), but this one was very quiet. it’s a new dial for the seamaster aqua terra 150m shades collection, this one in a gradient turquoise color and in both the 41mm and 38mm versions. i am pretty notoriously not a fan of the aqua terra collection, so don’t mind me as i don’t go crazy over this release. 

you know this collection, even though it is slightly different from the regular aqua terra collection. it’s less sporty and more dressy, with a fully polished case, a different bracelet and completely untextured dials that come with a sunray-brushed finish and bright colors. like i said, there are two sizes of the watch available, but they share a couple of basic facts — the dials are turquoise in the centre, fading to a black on the edges. the triangular applied markers, applied logo and hands are coated in dark grey pvd. at 6 o’clock is a date aperture with a dark grey date disc inside. they also have the same 150 meter water resistance, and the same bracelet with rounded links. 

they share the looks, but the hardware is ever so different. the larger of the two comes in a stainless steel case that measures 41mm wide, 13.3mm thick and with a 47.9mm lug-to-lug. inside is the calibre 8900, a co-axial escapement automatic that’s a master chronometer, metas certified with 2 barrels that give you 60 hours of power reserve. the smaller measures in at 38mm wide, 12.4mm thick and with a 44.9mm lug-to-lug. inside, you get a different movement, the calibre 8800 with the same metas certification, co-axial escapement, but with a single barrel and 55 hour power reserve. 

the new omega seamaster aqua terra 150m gradient turquoise is coming to stores soon at a price of €7,300 for either of the two sizes. see more [on the omega website](https://www.omegawatches.com/watch-omega-seamaster-aqua-terra-150m-co-axial-master-chronometer-41-mm-22010412103006?utm_source=www.itsabouttime.email&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=omega-adds-gradient-turquoise-dial-to-seamaster-aqua-terra-vulcain-teams-up-with-massena-lab-for-a-sensational-nautical-brew-s-new-take-on-the-metric-urwerk-has-a-new-ur-230-in-white-ceramic&_bhlid=c6d43e79e5ca3ceb04d87db373dca227b141af92). ",2024-12-12 16:38:41

you know this collection, even though it is slightly different from the regular aqua terra collection. it’s less sporty and more dressy, with a fully polished case, a different bracelet and completely untextured dials that come with a sunray-brushed finish and bright colors. like i said, there are two sizes of the watch available, but they share a couple of basic facts — the dials are turquoise in the centre, fading to a black on the edges. the triangular applied markers, applied logo and hands are coated in dark grey pvd. at 6 o’clock is a date aperture with a dark grey date disc inside. they also have the same 150 meter water resistance, and the same bracelet with rounded links. 

they share the looks, but the hardware is ever so different. the larger of the two comes in a stainless steel case that measures 41mm wide, 13.3mm thick and with a 47.9mm lug-to-lug. inside is the calibre 8900, a co-axial escapement automatic that’s a master chronometer, metas certified with 2 barrels that give you 60 hours of power reserve. the smaller measures in at 38mm wide, 12.4mm thick and with a 44.9mm lug-to-lug. inside, you get a different movement, the calibre 8800 with the same metas certification, co-axial escapement, but with a single barrel and 55 hour power reserve. 

the new omega seamaster aqua terra 150m gradient turquoise is coming to stores soon at a price of €7,300 for either of the two sizes. see more [on the omega website](https://www.omegawatches.com/watch-omega-seamaster-aqua-terra-150m-co-axial-master-chronometer-41-mm-22010412103006?utm_source=www.itsabouttime.email&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=omega-adds-gradient-turquoise-dial-to-seamaster-aqua-terra-vulcain-teams-up-with-massena-lab-for-a-sensational-nautical-brew-s-new-take-on-the-metric-urwerk-has-a-new-ur-230-in-white-ceramic&_bhlid=c6d43e79e5ca3ceb04d87db373dca227b141af92). ",2024-12-12 16:38:41

# brew has a new take on the metric, it’s the super metric with some great colors

i love how brew is doubling down on what they do best. centered around the concept of timing the perfect shot of espresso, brew has released a couple of dozen watches that have deep roots in vintage design. in reality, they only had two models, but with many, many, many color variations. and they do it incredibly well, at a great price. now, they have a new model. or do they? because the new brew super metric chronograph is very familiar to people who know the metric collection. but at the same time, a bit different. 

the case retains pretty much the same shape of the metric. it’s a cushion shape with an integrated bracelet, very inspired by 1970s chronographs. the stainless steel case measures 36mm wide, 10.75mm thick, with a 41.5mm length, with brushed surfaces and a flat crystal on top. on the side is a polished crown, flanked by two pushers — one polished and one anodized orange. water resistance is 50 meters. 

where the watches shine is on the dials. they all share the same rectangle sub-dials with cool positioning — at 6 for the small seconds with a vertical orientation, and at 10 o’clock for the 60-minute timer with a horizontal orientation. they all have vertical lined connecting the two sub-dials, grained finishes on the dial bases and a sloping flange on the preiphery that holds the minute scale. this chronograph seconds scale also has a highlighted portion between 25 and 35 seconds, which is the perfect timing for an espresso shot. 

there are four color options for the new super metric. the burnt orange is a combination of black, grey and orange; the royal blue has dark blue, grey, black and yellow; electric blue light blue, orange, yellow, black, grey and white; while the lumina yellow uses yellow, orange, dark blue, grey and black colors. they are all pretty good color combinations. 

inside is the seiko vk68 meca-quartz movement, which combines the best of both worlds. it gives you the precision of quartz to tell the time and the smoothness of a mechanical movement when you start the chronograph. the watches come on integrated steel bracelets. 

the brew watches super metric collection is available right now and priced at €458. see more[ on the brew website](https://www.brew-watches.com/collections/watches?utm_source=www.itsabouttime.email&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=omega-adds-gradient-turquoise-dial-to-seamaster-aqua-terra-vulcain-teams-up-with-massena-lab-for-a-sensational-nautical-brew-s-new-take-on-the-metric-urwerk-has-a-new-ur-230-in-white-ceramic&_bhlid=3aed6275777d53c25865417d7db4e00c6d1031e9). ",2024-12-12 16:39:00

# urwerk introduces the new ur-230 polaris now in white ceramic

go look over the urwerk website and you’ll see how many of their watches are black hunks of metal or composite materials with extremely bright accents on the numerals or movement components. so their new ur-230 polaris comes as bit of a surprise as it comes in a stark white, and it suits it really nicely. 

the case of the new ur-230 polaris is quite large, measuring 44.81mm wide, 18.38mm thick and 53.55mm long, as you would expect from a ur-230. the big difference is the new color, which is achieved with the use of a very cool ceramic-based composite. urwerk takes a polymer base and interweaves it with sheets of ceramic and lightweight silver-toned fiberglass plies. the color comes from the resin, which is machined to achieve the final shape, revealing all the layers inside. very cool. also, unlike the previous ur-230, it doesn’t have the cover for the crystal — instead, it’s completely opened. 

there’s no dial to speak of. instead, you get a look at the three-armed carrousel that carries rotating hour cubes for the wandering hours complication. the cube that points towards the wearer shows the correct time, and there’s a three-dimensional retrograde hand that sweeps along a dedicated track for the minutes. the hours, markers and automatic winding indicator all have white super-luminova that glows blue. the 60-minute mark and the “off” position for automatic winding are hand-painted with red lume that glows green. 

inside is the ur-7.30 calibre which beats at 4hz, with a 48 hour power reserve. the movement has a dual turbine system that minimizes the impact of external shocks and optimizes airflow to the winding mechanism. an adjustable “air brake” also allows fine-tuning of the winding efficiency. the watch comes on a rubber strap with a velcro closure. 

the new urwerk ur-230 polaris is available now, limited to 35 pieces. price is set at chf 150,000, without tax. see more [on the urwerk website](https://www.urwerk.com/collections/ur-satellite/ur-230?utm_source=www.itsabouttime.email&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=omega-adds-gradient-turquoise-dial-to-seamaster-aqua-terra-vulcain-teams-up-with-massena-lab-for-a-sensational-nautical-brew-s-new-take-on-the-metric-urwerk-has-a-new-ur-230-in-white-ceramic&_bhlid=1b1a86fdbb09747bd36e400e1e1123b7ea58bcd2).",2024-12-12 16:39:10

the mechanic ocean mkii actually forms the entry level into crafter blue’s watches, but you still get 300 metres of water resistance and features such as a 120-click unidirectional rotating bezel, which is dlc-coated and riveted into place (part of that overall feeling of gratifying solidity that i mentioned earlier). the action of the bezel is a delight, with just the right compromise between give and firmness, while the blue pip at the top gives it a distinctive purposefulness, co-ordinating with the seconds hand and the lume.

breitbartholomew,aqua terra,someone’s posted a 36mm quartz aqua terra on r/watchexchange today.,2024-11-28 02:23:12
grotejoh,aqua terra,"generally speaking , the aqua terras are great watches and are comparable in specs and utility to a rolex datejust,  they're robust and semi-dressy/semi-casual and can take on different personalities with different straps. first takeaway: better to buy watches in bracelets and then buy a few straps to swap, than to buy on strap and then source the bracelet afterwards.

omega as a brand is obviously solid.

regarding size, ats have historically come in a plethora of sizes between 34(?) mm and 40mm+, i think it is time well spent to try some on in a shop to figure the best fit for you.

regarding movements, you already mentioned you are looking to buy automatic (i e. mechanical). you should probably be aware why you want mechanical, because a quartz movement has mostly benefits (cheaper, more accurate, doesn't run out of power, more resistant to shock and magnetism, much longer service interval) whereas a mechanical has mostly drawbacks, but then again, you only get the funny little machine with all the whirly bits and pieces in the latter. 

regarding price, chrono24 is a great benchmark to see what the market is asking, but you can probably negotiate most sellers down somewhere between 10-20% of their asking price.but be aware, especially when buying an older used watch, that it may require a service... a service runs between. few hundred bucks from an independent watchmaker to high triple-digits for a factory service (see rates on the omega website)",2024-11-24 17:10:49
distracted_waffle,aqua terra,"this is the first generation aqua terra, generally considered to be the best  gen looks wise. these were sold between 2002 and 2008. it's the only version where the quartz and automatic are of the same quality. in later generation the knee capped the quartz version by removing applied indices for example.

  
as for auto/quartz it's just personal preference. i think most watch enthusiasts  will prefer the automatic but i specifically bought this reference in quartz to have one ""grab and go"" watch that looks good as well.

36mm for these is a great size imo, they do tend to wear a bit larger due to male endlinks so imo it wears more like a 38. 

you can't go wrong with these and i highly recommend them. 

2000 is a good price for these, i found one in mint condition and paid a little bit more than that.",2024-11-25 09:27:39

nbmtx,aqua terra,"chronomat's the best looking and omega's the best watch.

the chronomat is quite shiny in person. captivating, but maybe not what you're going for. secondhand prices are pretty decent.

if you're paying retail, the omega, all day. if you're buying secondhand, either would be good.

i personally see value in the certified breitling workhorse (at the right price). and if you'll actually use a gmt complication, that's handy, too. it'd still be useful to me as a 24hr indicator, to know what time of day it died. the bezel is also a good timer. i use rotating bezels as timing devices more than my chronographs.

i appreciate omega's metas movement, but the reality is that the value in it is largely diminished once you leave comment sections. at least until resale, if you're someone who intends to resell it, eventually. if you buy the chronomat secondhand at close to half the original msrp, it'll probably hold (that) value pretty well.

if i were buying either secondhand, i'd want the metas one to be more within spec, and i'd be a little more lenient with the cosc workhorse.

if you actually want something low profile, the aqua terra is a solid ""boring"" watch. if not, i think the breitling is a really good choice. it's air, land, and sea, all in one. it has a rotating bezel but wears like a gada three hand watch.",2024-11-07 13:19:31

i'm currently ruling out the speedmaster mainly because i don't want my daily driver to be a manual wind, i'd prefer to pick it up and go.

between the aqua terra and mark xx i'm leaning green aqua terra with potential plans to get the blue mark xx down the road in a year or two. i think the aqua terra seems like it will be more versatile in the meantime. 

biggest complaint about the at i've seen is the metal bracelet leaves a lot to be desired with no micro adjust etc, and the mark xx has one of the best metal bracelets available. but i'm not a big metal bracelet guy and will likely rotate the strap between a nato/sail cloth/leather so that doesn't bother me about the at. 

let us know what you decide and post pics! good luck with the decision, it isn't easy!",2024-11-05 23:30:35
_GTS_Panda,aqua terra,"out of these, i’d go with the aqua terra. but is there a reason grand seiko isn’t on the list. a white birch or snowflake has a better movement than all these watches and has finishing that is top-notch.

you can also get a huge discount if you order direct from japan because the yen is in the tank.

i love all watches, but my grand seiko is tied for first in my collection along with my silver snoopy.

this would leave the speedmaster and the iwc for me. i have tried both on, and i like them both. i would wear both. with that being said, given a choice between the two i would pick the iwc. another unpopular take :) the bracelet, finish and fit are all spectacular. it’s not in your face blingy (especially the matte black), but it looks damn good and is no slouch.  i also prefer the minimal, more conservative flieger asthetic so again, personal preference here. imo it’s a solid and more conservative alternative to a datejust.",2024-11-06 01:00:18

Low-Relative6688,speedmaster,"these are like the 5 most dissimilar watches to be considering so just be honest with yourself about why you're buying the watch. is it the performance, the brand cache, to add a different style or complication, etc.

1. i would lean speedmaster just because a chrono is very different from a diver, and it's a bit dressier than the rolex (partially polished links, polished pushers, etc) and it will overall hold it's value long term better than the others. it's iconic.
2. it's nice to have a different dial colors and the at is definitely dressier than the rolex or speedy. at is probably the closest you can get besides a sub to the perfect 1 and done watch. i'd recommend trying it on in person though. fully polished center links are quite a thing in person. pictures really don't do how shiny it is justice. definitely flashier than the submariner so that's kind of the opposite of what it sounds like you want. that said
3. nomos is by far the enthusiast pick here and zero risk of anyone trying to steal or think it's valuable. no one will look twice at it except other watch nerds. so totally different from your sub i think if you're actually interested in what that watch offers you will wear it a lot.
4. cartier is not exactly versatile design wise and a pretty bold design at that. i'd say you will probably end up just wearing your sub but obviously that's just a hunch.",2024-11-06 05:21:12

Free-Swan-9870,aqua terra,"thats all very iconic watches, i love them all for different reasons.

the aqua terra was my first lux watch love, it got a nice dial, love the brushed hands and indices, the alternating polishingand brushing, the see-through, the lyred lugs.. dont love the bracelet though

the iwc has very nice proportions, slim, and a very nice on the fly clasp which is also very slim, you also dont need tools to adjust the links, and it got 120 hours.. it may look a little boring for some though.

i love the moonwatch because of many of the same reasons as the at, also its just an icon, the new bracelet is superb, its truly timeless. 

the santos is actually the integrated watch i love the most, the 2017-present iteration is just perfection, the blued hands, the dial, how the bracelet is a very thought out package of it all, how it comforms too your wrist, i could go on and on…

the nomos got a bahaus style going for it that is very popular here in scandinavia, with a very cool complication.

this is a hard choice, will come back with an edit. also i recommend you to sleep on it, i feel like you are in the phase just discovering and loving so many of the icons/ modern icons.. go to an ad, try them out, get a feel for them.",2024-11-06 16:43:07

the **speedmaster** is an extremely close second. i own both and love them, buuuut if you're just getting a second watch and not planning to build out a collection then the at gives you the most ""range"" of wear.

the black bay gmt is a close second (being a ""luxury"" gmt at an affordable price).

that speedmaster and aquaterra are far behind.

things change if we put the classic speedmaster vs submariner.  
if we're talking about second-wrist prices, i'd buy the speedmaster any day.  
if we're talking about brand new watches, at around the same prices, i'd still buy the submariner, but speedmaster would be a really close second.  
the submariner holds its value so much better, it's sturdier, easier to maintain, and it's more convenient being auto.  
the speedmaster is just gorgeous and to me has more fascinating history, but the manual movement + high cost of maintenance make it so much less appealing for a one-watch collection.",2024-10-30 09:27:08

i got this as a very cliche gift to myself to mark a professional achievement. i have been looking for a clean blue dial watch like this for awhile now. what drew me to this piece in particular is the minimalistic, but elegant look. the newer aqua terra’s have a bit more noise on the dial, but this is perfect for me. 

i have a bit of a preppy dress style, so this watch is just perfect for my style by being leaning on the dressy style while still being a bit casual. can wear it with a blazer, button down, and pullover and it’ll look nice. doesn’t look too out of place on jeans and t shirt either. 

at first i thought the 36mm was a bit small. but i have smaller wrists and after a day of wearing it now think this is the perfect size for the style. 

really happy with this watch. i also went with omega due to their history and heritage. omega’s history and accomplishments fit in perfectly with the statement i wanted this gift to reflect. while this is a quartz movement, so nothing impressive with them, the movement is very smooth and is above what i’d expect in a quartz.",2024-10-27 17:05:54

i ended up falling in love with a classic watch that i thought would look too big on my wrists - an omega speedmaster.

in undergrad, i wanted the citizen eco-drive, but didn't get that one either since i thought my casio illuminator would be more robust.

at my first job, i wanted a bracelet watch, so went with an edifice and kept that till it broke a few years later, right before i joined my master's program. i was planning to replace it with another edifice, but then studies and whatnot came, so i put aside watches for a while.

after graduation and getting a job, i became close friends with one of my colleagues and he introduced me to his collection - alpinist, tissot prx, etc. which got me hooked on automatic watches.

he accompanied me while i went to get my first auto - hamilton khaki field titanium. that watch accompanied me through my unemployment phase and then i wore it to my first day at my new work as well.

to celebrate the new job, and a relocation, i wanted to get another watch. so i was planning on going for longines spirit zulu, since i felt a gmt would be cool!  
but then grand seiko caught my eye and i was looking at those for a while. i didn't get either because i was stocking up my emergency savings. once the savings were set aside, i found that these two watches didn't connect with me as much. i didn't feel like ""i need it!"", so i kept waiting.

nate2188764,seamaster,"this is such a great topic and one i’ve thought a lot about recently. 

i started with a lot of higher end stuff (jlc, omega, gs) and my tastes changed a lot during that time from high end dress pieces to high end tool watches etc. 

i really settled into a watch when i got an oris bcpd of all things my wife really loved it and so when we renewed our vows i wore that. over time it became my favorite watch. then i got a hamilton which i picked up on a whim because it was a good deal and i ended up wearing that a bunch too. long story short, i liquidated most of my higher end stuff because i was just getting more enjoyment out of the $1k-$2k range. i also found that i really love pilot and field watches. 

now i’m looking to slowly build out a collection of things i love without trying to chase pieces that other people think are great. i love my khaki field expeditoon even though others don’t like the compass bezel. i love my oris even with the 50m water resistance. do i wish i had things like otf adjustment and more power reserve, yes, but do i miss my speedy? not really. it was a great watch but i didn’t love it like i love my other watches and i used the extra funds to take the family on a trip where i made memories with a watch i love.

i can see picking up a neo-vintage iwc chronograph, maybe one of those new seamasters, but i really now prefer tool watches that look nice but not blingy. i can’t ever see a submariner in my collection for that reason. but i can absolutely see an iwc mark xx or better yet a spitfire. maybe a seiko sla079 too.",2024-12-03 14:29:24

what has changed is that i can appreciate gold and rose gold. 15 years ago i could wear 50mm watches and loved chronographs. after that 46mm, then 44mm... 40mm watches felt tiny on my wrist a couple of years ago, after wearing mostly panerai, but with some detox i am now comfortable wearing 41 and 40mm watches. although smaller watches seems to be coming into fashion, i'll still never go lower than 40mm. the omega aqua terra shades 38mm is pretty nice though...  i still like chronos, but also appreciate ""cleaner"" watches as much. love wearing my panerai because 95% of everyone you meet have no idea what it is, and the rest are watch aficionados. did not like the pepsi a decade ago, but i cannot take my eyes off the latest iteration.",2024-12-03 23:29:03

Pepejerjer,seamaster,"i was shopping at the ginza district in tokyo, a shopping district with a lot of watch shops that sell watches ranging from brand new to vintage.

i have always been an omega fan as my first watch was an omega seamaster, the one that pierce brosnan wears. however i have always been skeptical about the constellation line as it is not really popular from where i live and i wasn’t sure whether it would fit me. 

nevertheless, it somehow caught my attention when i saw it. it looked so unique and different in comparison with other omegas. so, i decided to give it a try and put it on my wrist. i don’t know how to describe it but i knew immediately that i wanted it. so i pulled the trigger and got it on the spot. a small souvenir to remember all the good things that happened in japan :)

waterproof: 100m",2024-08-14 13:02:00

as for the others, either jlc are great choices, followed by the omega, iwc, then rolex (that one is less understated, you might be better with a smooth bezel datejust or an op).

the omega and rolex are a bit more versatile and can be dressed down for weekends, but for your primary use case, i like the jlcs. i love the moonphase (yeah, not necessary but adds such beauty and class).

# what's new

**1/**

[**this is the new baltic prismic collection and it’s absolutely spectacular**](https://baltic-watches.com/en?utm_source=itsabouttime.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=this-is-the-new-baltic-prismic-and-it-s-absolutely-spectacular-omega-updates-the-41mm-constellation-with-meteorite-dials-vulcain-releases-the-grand-prix-new-from-minase-and-revolution-x-minase)

when a brand has a fantastic year, like baltic had in 2023, there are only two things that can happen - they can either have a slump year or go even harder and outdo everythign they’ve done in 2023. and they’ve done a lot. there was the brilliant new hermétique tourer line, their incredible colorful take on the field watch. they updated their classic watches - the mr01, hms 002 and bicompax 002 - in a wonderful gold/black colorway. and they introduced the incredible experiments premier quatrième perpétual, a perpetual calendar that was part of the brand new line of haute horology watches and was supposed to be auctioned off at only watch. 

seeing as how we’re in februrary, and baltic is introducing a brand new collection, they are going for the latter of the two options - going harder and outdoing 2023. the new collection is called prismic, made up of four super-thin watches with incredible colors and even better shapes and refractions. no wonder, seeing as how the collection is inspired by the geometric shapes and luminous refractions of a prism. 

starting off with the case, it gives away the prismic’s intent. sure, it takes on the shape of a traditional dress watch, but baltic points out that they went more in the “cocktail” watch direction with the flashy dials and actually complicated case construction. the case comes in at 36mm wide, just 9,2mm thick (an even svelter 7,4mm without the double domed crystal) and has a lug-to-lug of 44mm - all together an incredibly wearable offering. the case is made of five distinct parts with different finishes and materials - the bezel, lugs and caseback are made of stainless steel and are embedded onto a grade 5 titanium case with a slight grainy finish. the bezel shows off subtle finishing differences on two levels: the upper part is polished, contrasting elegantly with the lower part, using circular brushing. the lugs are polished on top and horizontally brushed on the sides. it’s not a sports watch, but a better water resistance than 30 meters would have been appreciated (although, this depends on whether baltic means actual 30 meters, or just hand washing). 

the material, finishes and colors get even wilder when you see the dial. all of the four possible color options have a deep guilloché pattern radiating from the center of the dial. the pattern is interrupted with a brushed sector where baltic placed the applied and polished indexes which have an almost pyramid-like shape. at 6 o’clock was the seconds sub-counter with a grained dial. even the hands are absolutely spectacular - dauphine shaped, deeply brushed on top and with highly polished chamfers. i really do suggest you click through to the baltic website to see more detailed photos. there’s so much to see. 

the prismic collection comes in four colors - purple, green, salmon or grey blue. all of them have a high shine on the dial and look completely unique and unlike anything else on the market. it’s great to see how well baltic is working with color. 

to keep things thin, baltic is using the hand-wound peseux 7001 caliber, which is just 2,5mm thick and developed by the swiss eta manufacture. it beats at 21,600 vph and has a decent power reserve of 42 hours. out back is a sapphire caseback, which is a great thing, as the movement is just as beautiful as the dials. decorations include diamond polished bevels, côtes de genève on the bridges, soleillage of ratchet and crown wheel, blued screws and beading of the main plate balance wheel. the watch comes on either an italian calf leather strap or a beautiful new brushed, braided mesh stainless steel bracelet. it look supple and very retro, with a sliding clasp and a quick release system. 

the new baltic prismic collection is available for pre-order now and the pre-order window closes in 10 days, on february 25th at 4pm central european time. the first batch will be delivered in july 2024 and the second in october. pricing is set at €990 for the leather strap and €1,050 on the metal bracelet, both without vat. it’s an incredibly busy watch, but in the best possible way. i think baltic has another hit on their hands, can’t wait to see what else they have in store. see more [**on the baltic website**](https://baltic-watches.com/en?utm_source=itsabouttime.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=this-is-the-new-baltic-prismic-and-it-s-absolutely-spectacular-omega-updates-the-41mm-constellation-with-meteorite-dials-vulcain-releases-the-grand-prix-new-from-minase-and-revolution-x-minase).

[**omega updates the 41mm constellation collection with brand new meteorite dials**](https://www.omegawatches.com/watches/constellation/constellation/catalog?pin=10727&utm_source=itsabouttime.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=this-is-the-new-baltic-prismic-and-it-s-absolutely-spectacular-omega-updates-the-41mm-constellation-with-meteorite-dials-vulcain-releases-the-grand-prix-new-from-minase-and-revolution-x-minase)

in a lineup of perfectly acceptable watches, the constellation stands out as the one controversial watch from omega. despite being their second oldest collection, proceeded only by the seamaster, the constellation, with the claws on the bezel, integrated bezel and very 80s look, is an acquired taste. some will tell you they adore it, others will say it’s the ugliest thing ever made. now omeg has modernized the constellation in their largest size, the 41mm, with 5 new colors with meteorite dials. 

despite omega also making a mid-sized constellation in 39mm, the new meteorite dials come only in the larger 41mm, three in steel and two in gold. aside from the new dials, it’s still the same constellation, meaning it measures 41mm wide, 13.5mm thick and with a pleasant 44mm lug-to-lug. the recognisable claws on the bezel are polished and present on both the gold and ceramic bezels and the case has rounded half-moon facets. 

there are a lot of firsts in this collection. it’s the first time the constellation is available in 18k moonshine gold and the first time the 41mm models are available with a steel bracelet. depending on the colour, the bezel is either ceramic (black ceramic for the silver version, green ceramic on the pvd green version) or metal, with the roman numerals in positive relief obtained by laser ablating (for the blue, moonshine and sedna versions). the blue version has a bezel in grade 5 titanium. 

speaking of the color, it comes from a pvd coat that is applied to the muonionalusta meteorite found in sweden. it’s a mostly iron-based meteorite with a significant proportion of nickel that has a classic widmanstätten pattern. the available coatings are sedna pvd gold, moonshine pvd gold, green pvd or blue pvd. the silver model isn’t pvd coated and has been finished with a galvanic treatment. depending on the model, the applied markers and the constellation star are either black pvd, 18k white gold, 18k moonshine gold or 18k sedna gold. 

inside the steel models is the calibre 8900 while the calibre 8901 is in the gold models, with the difference between the two being a solid gold rotor and balance bridge on the latter. the movements have a co-axial escapement, a silicon balance spring, double-barrels in series and a master chronometer certification. it beats at 25,200vph and has a 60 hour power reserve. 

the new omega constellation 41mm meteorite dial watches are available now in a range of prices. the blue retails for €10,300, the silver and green for €10,700 and the gold €46,600. see more [**on the omega website**](https://www.omegawatches.com/watches/constellation/constellation/catalog?pin=10727&utm_source=itsabouttime.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=this-is-the-new-baltic-prismic-and-it-s-absolutely-spectacular-omega-updates-the-41mm-constellation-with-meteorite-dials-vulcain-releases-the-grand-prix-new-from-minase-and-revolution-x-minase).",2024-02-15 15:09:49

improvthismoment,speedmaster,"i checked out that leaky omega speedmaster post. there is no indication of how old the watch is. it is the older generation speedmaster professional, you can tell from the bracelet. the poster said they got it about 2 years ago, so it must have been used as the current generation came out in 2021. there is also no mention of this watch being under warranty. this post is not even an anecdote of a new-ish watch still in warranty period failing its wr resistance rating. could very well be a well-used watch that was not pressure tested and maintained properly, which could happen to any watch, screw down crown or not. all watches that go in the water need to be maintained and pressure tested regularly, even with a screw down crown.

i'n not saying it's impossible for a new-ish omega to have a gasket failure, but omega has a very good reputation when it comes to meeting its wr ratings (unlike, say, hamilton).",2024-02-05 15:31:39

among speedmasters i have a special fondness for the moon phase versions, in part since the blue moonphase was my first speedy (and first omega). white, or here something more like silver, is such a great dial color for a speedmaster, and when you put it all together with the white gold case and blued hands it’s a fantastic piece.",2024-11-26 14:09:27

erishun,speedmaster,"just want to warn you… it might just kill your passion for watch collecting.

there’s a reason why ben clymer (hodinkee founder) says “*a lot of young people come to me and say ‘i have $5,000 and i want to buy my first great watch.’. to which i say, ‘you can get an omega speedmaster, and it’ll probably be your last great watch’.*”

you can wear it in the board room with a suit and you can wear it with shorts on the beach. it’s intricate and visually striking enough to not be “plain”, while also not being “too loud”. 

even when it’s not your newest watch or even your most expensive watch, it still ends up getting wrist time. i can’t say that about many watches. so often what expensive new watch that you absolutely loved and thought you’d daily drive forever... ends up being a box queen in a few months. happens all the time.

after getting the speedy pro, i really have much less desire for anything else i have or anything else in the future. it’s a damn near perfect “daily driver”",2024-04-29 10:41:47

today i’m back again to the bracelet from nato strap on my speedmaster racing 40mm version. nato was really comfortable, lightweight and seeming amazing and perfectly fitting especially with a yellow stripe. on the other hand bracelet is more classy and make you feel the watch more. it makes also not feeling too high the case which is a huge plus considering the watch height is 15mm. 

about the watch i’m super excited and satisfied even after a long time with it. accuracy is perfectly fine and pampering, build quality is always good since it’s a speedmaster. maybe the only negative thing is the aluminium bezel. ceramic could be way better than this in terms of long life. 

if you have questions and remarks, i would be happy to answer 😉

once again, happy speedy tuesday y’all! 🍾🎉🥳",2023-03-14 08:25:33
mcn_87,speedmaster,"congrats 🎉 it’s a one which pampers you with its quality. that’s why speedmaster is a dream for almost all watch lovers. dial is a killer one for sure in many ways. black/gray & yellow is one of my favourite color combinations, so i love it. racing style fits perfectly for a speedometer watch. on the other hand it’s readability is also very good. the size of the case is phantastic with 40mm. if it matters accuracy makes you amazed, too. as a daily being an automatic is a huge plus. i hope you wear in a good health and it would make you happy for ever.",2023-03-15 03:53:13
fuzzyfrank,speedmaster,"here's my picture for speedy tuesday, with two omegas! the right is my speedmaster reduced that i've had for a almost 2 years now, while the right is an omega pocketwatch my girlfriend got me for valentine's day. i love both, and i think it's cool to have two omega watches from almost 85 years apart! omega is definitely an interesting brand, with a lot of heritage. 

i love the speedmaster reduced, and it turns out a lot of other people do as well- the prices for them have been slowly creeping up over the past few years, it's pretty wild. it's a classic design and a strap monster, so i understand why.",2023-02-28 16:46:24

still, a good watch.",2023-02-28 22:37:20
frozenboricua,speedmaster,"a mark ii in good condition is worth about three to four times what you paid for yours a decade ago. did you ever find the speedmaster and, if so, which one is it for you?",2023-02-28 22:46:40
frozenboricua,speedmaster,"i think the modern reissue is a beautiful piece, but i prefer the original for several reasons. for starters, i like vintage watches not just for the looks, but also for their place in horological history, so i tend to look for period pieces, preferably unpolished, with their original movement and as un-retouched as possible. 

i also prefer my chronographs without a date window. the modern reissue has one and i think it looks cramped in and out of place. 

lastly, i think the modern reissue, which is larger, would look too big on my wrist. it would also be more prone to get banged against things. i prefer watches in the 35-42mm diameter range. the original mark ii is 41.75 x 45mm; the contemporary mark ii is 42.4 x 46.2 mm. might not seem like much, but it is noticeable. look at this side by side picture [here.](https://www.watchtime.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/omega_speedmaster_markii_old-new_wrist_560.jpg)

globalbiryani,speedmaster,"finally added the ultraman to my collection. had been searching for a lnib specimen for a while and finally landed it. i am stoked ☺️. i love this playful interpretation of the classic speedmaster by omega. special touches all around, like the use of orange, the first 3 minutes on the chrono dial marked as special and the ""dot over 90"" bezel! one of my favorites of the numerous les that omega has released of the speedmaster.  i especially like the fact that, for once, omega decided to not take the whole ""moon watch"" legacy too seriously 😊.

ouij,speedmaster,"i went and got myself a moonwatch. 

i had a bit of good fortune recently and i decided maybe i should treat myself. i went to my local dealer thinking i’d try on a few watches and think about it before i got one. i was kidding myself. i went in and asked if i could see the moonwatch along with a longines zulu time. i liked the zulu time a lot, but they didn’t have the one i really wanted in stock (green bezel, anthracite dial). i tried on a longines big eye and liked it but it was really thick. 

i put on the speedmaster and it fit like it was made for me. didn’t even have to re-size it or anything. 

this is the “base model”: hesalite crystal, solid back, all-brushed bracelet links. and you know what? it’s really the one i want. i love the way the crystal is domed. i love the proportions of the case—it really does feel a lot thinner and smaller than you’d think it would on paper. i love the bracelet. 

also, it’s surprisingly useful. i work by billable hour. i’ve started using the chronograph to track my work time. 

observations: the winding seems heavy and solid—not something i’ve been used to. the chronograph pushers feel like they’re breaking in—they were kind of stiff on first actuation but they have been smoothing out with use.",2022-08-09 14:26:32
AlphaMike1090,speedmaster,"hello, first post here, and first speedy tuesday with my new (to me) omega speedmaster professional, reference 3590.50! this reference is essentially the same as the 145.022, the first speedmaster to use the caliber 861 movement. it is different from other modern speedys, with no accent marking over the ‘e’ in tachymetre, and with the t swiss made t at the bottom of the dial, noting the use of tritium.

when shopping for my speedy, i had three criteria: cheaper than a new speedy, use of tritium, and birth year. i was fortunate enough to pull off all three and couldn’t be happier!

some observations after almost a week of wear:

i can see why the hands moved from broad arrow down to sticks, as the chronograph minute and hour hands can be difficult to read at times, even with stick hands. the hands are surprisingly not always at 10 and 2!

i was initially turned off by the bracelet since it is difficult to slide over my hand when properly sized to my wrist. this is due to the stamped metal folding arms being shorter and so the opening is smaller than what you would find in a milled clasp system. the bracelet is also a hair-puller when it is slid on and off. however, once the bracelet is in position and closed, it is extremely comfortable. i’m sure that this is due to the very small links and plenty of micro adjustment holes in the clasp.

finally, this is my first luxury watch after plenty of seikos, micro-brands, and homages, and i was surprised by how small this watch actually wears, but how heavy it feels when i’m holding it and winding it.

overall, i’m very happy with my purchase, and would recommend to anyone who wants to get into the speedy game (without paying your dominant hand) to look into the 90s speedmasters. i hope you enjoyed reading, and i look forward to joining the community and posting more pictures of my speedy!",2022-08-02 15:42:48
vanpatten,speedmaster,"this is my first speedy tuesday. i recently added this fois and bought a forstner contemporary flatlink to go with it. 

the forstner supplements and encourages the vintage feel of this speedmaster. the speedy design is so timeless the way it is, but something about the pre-moons have always spoken to me. it’s like a subset of speedy culture. 

i have also purchased the famed ed white bracelet that can be used with the forstner end links to fit this watch, so i’m going to give the omega bracelet a shot as well. i’ve heard it’s worth the price and is an excellent upgrade to the fois. should be here soon to compare the two. 

i will say the forstner is solid, but still has that vintage bracelet feel. it’s not cheap feeling at all, but i’m interested to see how the ed white feels in comparison. 

either way, a flatlink on a speedy is a classic. i’d recommend one to any speedy owner.",2022-07-26 18:43:47
HusarTicTokShop,speedmaster,"celebrating speedy tuesday with the speedmaster date ref 323.30.40.06.001. 

couple of differences from the speedy pro, obvious one being the date at 4:30. also the 40mm size wears nice for those with smaller wrists, opposed to the 42mm for speedy pro. 

also omega’s automatic calibre 3304 is nice for those that don’t love a manual wind. i think it’s great that omega stays as authentic as possible with the speedy pro, but ventures out and does different things with the line. 

the grey dial is really what stands out on this watch, it’s a bit of a sunburst pattern, extremely striking.",2022-07-12 16:30:03
CowboyMathematician,speedmaster,"i received my speedmaster 38 reference 324.30.38.50.01.001 just last week and i couldn't be happier. while the speedmaster professional fit my smaller wrist surprisingly well, i decided that the automatic movement and the water resistance were more important to me. the date wheel is also a big bonus.

i was torn between buying a speedmaster reduced and the 38. however, after reading about the high maintenance costs of the reduced, the 38 was a no brainer. also, the prices for the reduced have gotten insane and it didn't really make sense for me to pay the same amount for a 10 year old watch when i could buy a new one.

personally, fois is the only appealing speedmaster for me because of the lugs and the hour ticks being longer than some of the speedmasters have. honestly, the 2022 novelties brought this look back, which i am happy.",2022-05-10 15:05:26
mozi88,seamaster,"not dumb at all imo. i do love the sapphire back case that shows the engineering, the mechanical action and the tiny, intricate moving parts of (expensive) watches because, why not!? it’s part of the appeal and flex imo. it’s part of the wow factor and why i love them in the first place!

do i wish my fois has a sapphire back case? yep. is it a big deal for me? not really. most of the time, i’ll be seeing the face 95%. the only actual time i would like to see the sapphire back case is if i would like to have others take a peak inside, which is rare with the case (pun intended) of my seamaster.

i think it’s personal preferences. but either choice, you can’t go wrong.",2022-05-10 17:37:43
OrcaTheBoat,speedmaster,"it’s the middle of the flower and garden festival at epcot and i couldn’t resist stopping to smell the flowers, taking some macro shots, and of course wearing my speedy out. i have never been more pleased with a watch before. i’ve only had it two weeks now but i can’t stop looking at it. i know it’s termed a “strap monster” but i just love it on the original bracelet. the hesalite is wonderful in the sunshine and the dial depth shines through.

Beziano,speedmaster,"this is my first speedy tuesday… i think. most of the time i miss it but because i have this thing on my wrist i figured i would use this speedmaster to actually time some things today. ya know… use the watch for it’s intended purpose. here’s what i’ve come up with so far.

it takes a 12 week old german shepherd puppy 13 minutes and 46 seconds to take a poop when let outside. in the meantime they take a pee, nibble grass, roll around, and pick up sticks all while you’re waiting for a good boy to drop a deuce.

it takes 6 minutes and 17 seconds to fill the gas tank of a chevy silverado from completely empty. my favorite part is watching the number go up. exciting stuff.

it takes me 14 minutes and 28 seconds to get from a parking spot at the gym to my parking spot at work. if you had asked me this yesterday i would have quoted 10 minutes instead of a more appropriate 15. 

lastly, when a road rep sends a text that says “i’ll be there in 5 min.” what they actually mean is “i’ll be there in 7 minutes and 38 seconds” . 

other considerations for today are:
-how long until i can actually eat my lunch because as usual i’ve over done it with the microwave

-amount of time it takes to set up a pa system when all of the parts are actually in the right place

-elapsed time between taking multiple shots of tequila and feeling the effects. gotta remember to hit the pusher on this one.

ThePhysicist_,speedmaster,"i jokingly said to my fiance this morning, ""i finally get to participate in speedy tuesday""! 

everything lined up for me to get my grail the other day. the mini vacation we were on was awesome, the store i got it from was awesome, the guy who owned the store was awesome, i got 15% off which is awesome, and best of all it was the anniversary of the apollo 16 moon launch. it was all very much meant to be. the exact moon watch i wanted 👍

anyways, here's my new omega speedmaster professional 3861 with hesalite crystal. this has been my grail since i first got into watches in 2019 and so i put a lot of thought into which version of the speedmaster i wanted. the biggest decision being wether i go vintage or not. ultimately i decided on new because i knew i was going to be wearing this a ton once i got it. i also didn't want to feel bad for bonking it on anything. this way, it's all my patina. 

further, i knew i wanted something as close to the references that actually went to the moon i could get. so that was the big choice between hesalite and sapphire. it was the hesalite that went to the moon, not the sapphire. also i love the speedmaster caseback. 

all in all, it feels a little weird to be for the most part complete with my watch collection. nothing else on my list that i just have to have. it's a good feeling though. now i get to order myself a forstner flat link bracelet for the speedmaster 👍👍",2022-04-19 23:04:06

dparrish209,speedmaster,"i was inspired by another post made yesterday and decided to share my two hobbies; watches and specialty coffee. my hesalite speedmaster with the caliber 3861 has been an absolute dream to own for the last few months. i picked it up just before christmas in 2021 after lusting after it for the past 12 years. i've been into watches since i was a little kid and grew up rocking ironmans and g-shocks. i first saw the speedy when i was in high school and its as being worn by a chef in a nice restaurant i was in. from that moment i was hooked and couldn't wait to buy it. fast forward to today, as an engineer in the aerospace industry its a must have watch in my opinion and will forever be my favorite in my small collection of watches. 

as for the equipment in the background, i got into specialty coffee during the pandemic as a way to pass the time. little did i know that the specialty coffee and espresso hobby is as deep (and expensive) a rabbit hole as luxury watches is! like many others, i found james hoffman on youtube and the rest was history. for anyone curious, my espresso bar consists of a rocket appartamento and niche zero among other bits and bobs.",2022-04-12 15:08:14

as we close in on the end of the year, this was definitely my most worn watch. but the black bay 58 has been making a late push for the title. heading into 2022, but guessing these two watches will account for ~80% of the time on my wrist, unless something unforeseen and exceptional is released. i know the speedy and 58 are probably overly popular in the enthusiast community, but within a certain budget they’re incredibly hard to beat.",2021-12-28 20:59:10

here is my speedmaster professional ref 3590.50. i got this watch december 2020, and since then i've wanted to buy a flat link bracelet for it due to how nice the flat link looks on my lorier neptune. 

the realistic choices were between uncle seiko and forstner. i was going to buy them both and try them out, but after reading a few reviews online, i feel like the consensus was the forstner one was better (however it is more expensive so maybe that makes sense?). i found one used and bought it after waiting quite a while!

initial reaction is that it's nice. i think i overhyped it in my head thinking the flat link bracelet would wear on my speedmaster like it wears on my lorier neptune. i like the look of it, and it is light. i prefer the oem bracelet in terms of comfortability, fit and style, however this does add a different aesthetic to the speedy. it's been a bit less than a week so maybe my opinion will change!",2021-08-31 14:25:59

Dirk_Beefslab,speedmaster,"i had been eyeing speedmaster for a long, long time, and after a fortuitous bonus at work, i had a chunk of change to begin a search.

after trying a moonwatch on, i decided it was a bit too large for my wrist, and i preferred to look at one of the automatic speedy variants with a date function.

the speedy reduced came into play, but i wasn’t happy with the prices on most compared to their condition. i’d been looking at the 326.30 racing, but its subdial layout always felt off to me. 

i hardly ever see these on here or watch forums, but i came across this 323.30 speedmaster date recently, and negotiated a great price. it arrived in immaculate condition.

the offset date window still bothers me a bit, but the fact that it’s close to me on my right wrist helps for some odd reason. the dial is spectacular - a dark gray sunburst that pops in the light. 

it’s a thick watch but wears fairly thin - the tapered bezel and layered design helps visually.

love, love, love this watch. got a black silicone, a red canvas, and a brown vintage leather strap trio on their way. i’m excited to see how much of a strap monster these are.",2021-08-11 00:14:00

Wingnut13,speedmaster,"while nobody has ever called me a master of it, i do love speed. and all things space related. some years ago i had a panda dial caliber 3304 but i still always longed for the moon watch. the timeless design and history is just such a draw to me. so, the other day it was finally time for the omega speedmaster to make a return to my collection, this time with the moon watch. i did go with the sapphire sandwich cuz i’m a sucker for movement porn and the 3861 looks fantastic.

in my opinion, omega crushed it with this new model. it wears a little smaller and the tapered bracelet is so comfortable. the master chronometer specs are impressive so far and it’s peace of mind that it’s effectively impervious to magnets. i do kinda wish it still came with the giant box and all though. seems that’s reserved for the new 321s. the new little box is still nice, and has a travel box too.

could not be happier to have this in my collection!",2021-07-27 18:31:38

i'm not normally into sapphire crystals and display backs on a speedy, but it works on this watch. it's just too mesmerizing to watch the 321 run. the steel bracelet is lovely — incredibly comfortable and just the right heft on the wrist.

i grew up wanting nothing more than to go to space. it's a sort of silly sentimentality, perhaps, but this watch feels like a gift from a time traveller; an artifact of humanity's first tentative steps into the unknown heavens.",2021-07-27 16:44:47

Beast66,speedmaster,"i know that speedmasters are so common that they're practically a meme on here, but for me the speedmaster has been a dream watch for a long time and i honestly can't believe that i actually own one. i got this 1863 sapphire sandwich as a gift from my parents for graduating law school, so to me this watch represents the culmination of 3 years of hard work for months at a time with no days off, late nights, and lots of finals-related stress. law school was by far the most difficult thing i've done in my life, but also one of the most rewarding. and to me, the speedmaster is the perfect watch to celebrate my transition from being a student to being a professional.  

i'm in the middle of bar prep right now (i'm taking the ca bar for those who are curious), which is the final hurdle for me to get over before i get to start my career. bar prep is a very stressful and intense period filled with lots of memorization, learning new topics, and lots and lots of practice tests. to me, right now, this watch symbolizes both how far i've come in order to get to this point and the possibilities the future may hold for me. i can't wait to wear it in the office.

i'll certainly be using the met and pet functions for their designated purpose. of course the chrono will see some use, and the alarms might just be loud enough to wake me up for shift changes!

prolificity,speedmaster,"i appreciate that there are a lot of speedmasters on this sub, but i wanted to post mine to talk specifically about the accuracy of the new model. i’ve had this since april, and over 60 days it has averaged a gain of just under 1s/day, even less if i wind it every 18 hours. 

i’ve had 2 cosc chronometers before (both christopher wards), and several decent automatics with reliable movements. but all of the watches i’ve had before were near to the outer limit of their accuracy specification. the 3861 is the first movement i’ve owned that is so comfortably within spec, and it blows my mind that it manages that while being subject to the most demanding requirements.

it's tuesday today, and that of course means that i'll be wearing my 1861 (.005) omega speedmaster pro!

bought this a bit over a year ago.  had had my eyes on a speedy pro for quite some time and had been home on paternity leave for 10 months with my son. thinking that i wanted to celebrate this, i bought this to use and then hand over to the son in the future at a good time, e g graduating from university or similar. (who am i kidding? i wanted the speedy but felt that i had to have a good reason...)

really love this watch. can't really find anything that i don't enjoy! solid history, great looks, good performance and fits perfectly on my wrist. the only downside is the wr i guess, but then again, omega themselves say that their 50m rating is good for swimming and i don't exactly dive... however, it's a good reason for needing another watch in addition to the speedy :)",2021-06-08 09:03:06
remrk7,speedmaster,"the speedmaster pro was my first luxury watch purchased back in 2015. this was my daily for 2.5 years. as you can see it’s been scratched up along the way. i love the hesalite crystal as it adds a warmer tone to the dial and is easily buffed out of any scratches. 

i wasn’t a huge fan of the original bracelet due to the way the end links overhang, essentially extending the lug to lug length. i recently installed an uncle seiko 1450 bracelet and in my opinion makes the fit better on my smaller wrist. 

my only complaints on this watch is the accuracy. it gains about 7-10 seconds a day. i think this has since been corrected with the new 3681 though. to me the new smp is what i’d be looking for in a speedy. more accurate movement, nicer bracelet, etc. but due to sentimental reason, i probably could never let this watch go.",2021-05-18 14:56:47

Big-Shtick,speedmaster,"here is my speedmaster. y'all have seen it before, but this is a new picture. i put it back on the oyster because i love the faux newman vibes. 

however, this time **there are two listed on chrono24**. these are the only ones i have seen for sale in the last two years since i bought mine, and it's nice to know the model has appreciated.  if you search for ""323.30.40.40.02.001"", you'll find that one is being sold in japan and one in the states. i warn you that you're paying for the aesthetic and for one of the few references that seemingly increase in value (albeit at a snails pace), but at least service costs on the eta7750 are relatively cheap.

i only mention this because a dozen people asked me about this particular reference last time i posted it, and i got excited when i saw that there were some finally listed. i'm not affiliated with the sellers in any way, and am just sharing the news. don't shoot the messenger. 🤷‍♂️ 

as a refresher, this model was released in 2009 as a limited edition with only 2009 of them made. it runs a modified eta7750 and has about a 40 or 48 hour power reserve. i get about -4 seconds on mine after two years of ownership. i don't know when it was serviced last. lug width is 19mm and case size is 39mm. lug to lug is maybe 47mm. it doesn't overhang on my 6.25"" wrist. it's maybe 14mm thick, but it wears comfortably on my wrist.

BackOutToAllenHis3PT,speedmaster,"my first ""serious""/luxury watch. 
omega speedmaster professional ""sapphire sandwich"". 

i opted to get this one instead of the hesalite, since i'm afraid of scratches and i enjoy being able to see the movement, and instead of the new 2021 model because of budget, but i love this model just as much, especially since i got a pretty good price for it. 
my job requires me to be in a suit and tie, so i can't wait to dress this up a bit with leather straps in the future.

i have a fairly skinny wrist, so going in, i was afraid a 42mm watch would look comically large on me, but after trying it on, decided it looked fine(at least to me, feel free to let me know if you disagree). 

in my mind, this is good enough for me to be my only watch, at least until i can afford to buy a lange 1 or a saxonia, my grails. but then again, that's probably how the addiction starts.

everyone's big concern online was whether or not the edges are actually sharp, and unfortunately i have to agree that the underside edges of the watch are indeed slightly sharp. that being said, it's not a deal breaker for me personally since you never notice it on the wrist and its really not as bad as others are making it out to be. try it out for yourself and see how you feel.

this watch is probably the coolest of all the speedmaster special edition references, in my opinion. the detail on the dial and the movement is absolutely crazy. i love how they took the heritage of this watch and turned it into a piece of wearable art. the decoration is fantastic and there are little details to take in everywhere.


the watch is very light weight due to the ceramic case. the bezel is also fully luminous, which just looks incredible.


another thing i notice is how well the ar coating on the crystal works to make the dial pop. i absolutely love it, and really am sad to let this one go. going to be on watchexchange soon, but figured i’d practice some macro shots and share the awesomeness of this reference.

yesterday, these two welcomed into the collection the patriarch of the monta clan. i picked up a black gen1 monta oceanking on rubber. being a bonafide monta fan, it’s kinda cool being able to have the watch that started the brand. since it’s debut, there have been several updates to the watch so it’s not perfect, but it’s definitely a strong piece. from their inception, it’s clear that monta was going to become a respected player in this space. while still a young brand, their following is loyal and happily heaps praise upon them... with good reason. so happy speedy tuesday to my fellow speedmaster owners, but happy belated monta monday to my monta amigos.",2021-02-02 17:33:50

delugs-straps,speedmaster,"hi r/watches, happy speedy tuesday! wanted to share my speedmaster story.

the classic speedmaster was my first foray into the world of higher end watches, given how universal it looked and how versatile it was with leather straps. i first got the omega speedmaster sapphire sandwich after finding it at a good price (who wouldn't want to see the casebook of a chronograph movement?)

following that, i dived deep into the world of speedys and decided that i wanted what couldn't be easily found - the speedy tuesday 1. this was late in 2019, so i was not lucky enough to get it at retail. after many weeks/months of scouring the corners of the interweb, i found a dealer that managed to source for one at a decent price (still above retail, but it wasn't too bad). added it to my collection, and i thought i was done...

...until i read and saw more photos of the mitsukoshi dial on instagram. wow. that panda dial really got to me. the originals were way out of my price league, so the search was on for a modified variant. after many months of stalking the local watch marketplace, someone finally put his up on sale, and i pounced.

today, i consider myself extremely lucky to own all 3 variants. am i done with the speedmasters? probably not, especially with the latest snoopy speedmaster. but i think i'll be done for a while - my preference is now trending towards thinner watches, and at some point chronographs are a little big.

the second watch is a seamaster deville, 14k gold front with stainless steel back, a recent acquisition through my grandfather’s passing (which wile unfortunate, was a long time coming and peaceful). he was a great man and was apparently gifted this watch by an industry organization he led in 1971 (per engraving on the back). i’d like to get it serviced, what is the best way to do that from the nyc area? i know there is a service center in nj but thought i’d ask here if there are any best practices i should be aware of before shipping it off. i’d like to ensure that the engraving on the back is maintained and all is kept as original as possible. thanks in advance for any help!",2021-01-26 14:38:28

alltheblue,speedmaster,"hi, not sure as i've not had an extract done but the serial number points to the early side of -74 production. i'm probably in at just over £3000 but that's only because i had the dnn bezel to hand and sold the don to balance the books a bit. took quite a while to source the parts (correct caseback in particular). you wouldn't be able to buy one for that but i did take a bit of a risk in the watch (indeed the first watchmaker i went to advised me to part it out!), but i'm really pleased with it now and know exactly where it's at!

there's a lot of pitfalls in buying a vintage speedmaster, i'd recommend thoroughly reading through speedmaster101 and if you can afford to buy the moonwatch only book, it's a tremendous resource. i'd also say, it's all in the dial and hands for me. i'd rather have a watch with a few wrong bits but a lovely matching dial and handset (hence buying this in the first place!) hope this helps.",2021-01-13 08:01:04

one of the best things about the speedmaster pro is how versatile it is. i’ve never had it on a strap that didn’t work. the olive nato strap i’ve got it on is my favorite. it’s comfortable and looks great with it.

i have this everest strap for a rolex explorer i (also fits the sub) that i no longer have but it also works well on the speedy.

between these 2 and the bracelet, i’m pretty well sorted, i think. i do like the black nato that came with the speedy from time to time but if i’m wearing it on a nato, the green is my go-to.

years ago, i had an awesome custom strap from gasgasbones that i would love to order again but they always seem backlogged and their store is often offline because of that. if i can ever order from there again, i will.

M3ANMACHINE,speedmaster,"after longing for a speedmaster for many years, i had told myself that prior to the birth of my first child (any day now) i would gift myself with a memorable timepiece to commemorate the big step in life. after going back and forth with several options i continued to find myself looking up the speedmaster reduced. my wrist size is a 6.5-6.75, and while i think i could pull off the \~41mm professional, there is something about the smaller 39mm proportions of the reduced that i really enjoy.

after browsing multiple forums, i came across a listing here on reddit and was able to make a deal with a member here within a couple days. watch, box and papers included. i was thrilled. thanks again, zac!

this particular piece dates back to around 1993 with a beautiful patina on the hands and hour markers which i love. the strap is from threaded leather co., i have the same strap for my skx007 as well so i knew it would be excellent quality!

overall i’m very happy to be a part of the speedy gang and will eventually plan to pickup a professional sapphire sandwich in the future as well.

as opposed to the more common 3510, this one sports a sapphire crystal and a stronger 100m rating. it also has a moon in it...just kidding, used a little photoshop for this one.

for a smaller wristed guy, the reduced makes more sense from a wear-ability standpoint. the dimensions are just under case 39mm and more importantly 44mm lug to lug. 

now some cons - i owned a 3510 that had a hour counter slightly off. bought this in practically mint condition, but then just a day or so again i saw that the hour counter hand also shifted a bit off the tick mark. from what i can tell this is a common issue and it's best to leave sleeping dogs lie especially with this modular movement.

pocongmandi,speedmaster,"hi guys! this is my first post here. i'm dedicating my first post here to a recent purchase of mine one week ago. this is the citizen ca7030-97e, a 2019 jdm release(correct me if i'm wrong but as far as i know this is a jdm release). i know that this is somewhat of an homage to the omega speedmaster, but i feel that this not a blatant homage, and it still has that citizen vibe to it. it is a solar quartz using the famous eco-drive technology; low maintenance, sapphire glass, 100 meters of water resistance, an absolute tool watch. i absolutely love the sizing of this watch (41mm diameter) compared to other gigantic tacky citizen watches. i've always want to scratch that speedmaster itch, and i think that this watch nails it.",2020-06-09 15:38:44
jasonnolanreed,speedmaster,"this is my new-to-me speedmaster reduced 3539. my watch collecting journey has seen my tastes change from not understanding what people like about the speedmaster, to starting to ""get it"" and wanting one, to trying on a professional and being disappointed with how it fit me, to finding out about the reduced models.

after lots of research and thinking it over, i decided the second iteration of the reduced, the 3539, was the one for me. as cool as hesalite is, i tend to prefer sapphire. i love wearing my watches on bracelets, so the more solid bracelet/clasp/end links over the 3510 were important to me. and, finally, although the numerals inboard the minute track of the 3510 are a nice part of its identity, i do side with the aesthetic of having them gone in the 3539.

it's not a moon watch, which is a shame. it doesn't make up for that with the practicality of a date, which is a shame. and still, for me, it's the best speedmaster i could have gotten my hands on.",2020-06-09 14:24:10

AP2low,speedmaster,"a long awaited end to my journey, the speedmaster reduced. i first started looking at this watch around december of 2019, from the minute i saw it i knew i had to have it! this is my biggest purchase by far with the 2nd most expensive watch in my collection being a 1st gen lorier neptune. i think what drew my attention the most was the value, i think it’s a steal at its price point compared to a real speedy and i also believe it will hold some value if not gain a bit! i was always too late to get one over on watchexchange so i started looking around locally and on ebay. after a few months of losing bids on ebay i found the perfect watch, minor to no imperfections, full kit; omega cardboard box, red omega carry box, papers, warranty cards, hell even the manual for a price i couldn’t pass on. this watch definitely cured my itch for something vintage/luxurious so i do not see myself buying anything for some time. i hope to enjoy it as much as everyone else i’ve seen on here and will take it on my desk diving journeys in the office or wherever else life takes me! cheers to everyone and i hope you are all safe and in good health.",2020-06-03 00:15:51
OldSweaterman,speedmaster,"today, june 2nd is my first speedy tuesday ever. i've always been a big fan of what the speedmaster represents. not only the iconic design but also the rich history had me longing for one for a long time. my father, also a big watch fan has always had a few speedys in his collection. a broad arrow, a speedy mark ii, a vintage to titanium speedy, the speedy holy grail and this speedy, the speedmaster 3575.20.00. he purchased the watch in hong kong and ever since he first showed it to me around ten years ago i've been a bit fan of it. i really love the classic black and white speedy and i've had so many conversations with people that were wearing one. but i also love to have something that stands out a little. 
last week after finally receiving my grade for my final bachelor's exam my dad gave me this watch as a gift. i still find it hard to believe that is now actually my watch and i am going to wear it for the rest of my life until i hopefully get to pass it on. shooting for 1000+ speedy tuesdays.

the triple date is kind of an odd duck in the speedmaster world. it's smaller than the professional, but has an in house movement caliber 1151 which is based on the eta/valjoux 7751, so no wonky tacked on chrono like the reduced. the dial is a bit busy, but this is also one of the most complicated watches omega has ever put out so it's definitely an interesting reference.",2020-05-19 18:59:04

saxmannate,speedmaster,"taking my old good boy out for a walk and loving how well he matches my recently acquired 3570 speedy. i love this watch, although i have to admit that i’m a bit tempted to flip it for a new speedmaster. my reasons are two-fold: 1. to have lume. 2. to have a luxury watch that is mine from the start. there is something about the idea of a watch with which every memory is mine that i can pass on to my son in 15 years. 

a perfect option would be to buy a brand new speedmaster that had tritium, one in which i could watch the patina process happen through the years. unfortunately, that’s not an option.

what are your thoughts? should i stick with the beauty of patina or get something new? i’m really torn. in the meantime, i’ll continue to enjoy and to baby this watch. and, of course, to love this good boy!",2020-05-19 12:32:43
WildEnkidu,speedmaster,"for what is worth - i bought a new speedy pro for the reasons you described.  it was my first 'real' watch and i bought it in march for my 40th birthday.  my son was born a week ago; i am hoping to pass this watch on to him at some point in his life.

i love old speedys; in many ways, they draw closer to the moonwatch heritage that is part of the joy (for me) of speedmasters.  however, for a hopeful heirloom piece, i really wanted something where every ding and scratch was mine - something that my son could remember me winding and wearing every day to work.

again, my two cents.  i think that you very reasonably make an argument in the other direction.  just because the watch has a history before you doesn't mean it won't have a more important (for your son) history with you.

your current watch is beautiful, btw...",2020-05-19 13:36:28

-these yellow colored 861's have 18 jewels even though the bridge is still stamped 17 jewels.
 
-the original 812 end links are shorter than the lug width causing the bracelet to form to the wrist better.

this reference of course draws it’s colourful dial from the rocket tintin used to get to the moon, but due to the collaboration with tintin’s creators falling apart omega released the watches with the chequered pattern only. it’s very striking in person, and now quite sought after due to the small production run.

after getting the diver, i wanted a versatile watch that i can wear to work. the speedy is a natural choice and i have always preferred the hesalite version - how often would i look at the case back anyway? i also thought that the cost of maintaining the hesalite crystal (polywatch and inevitably some servicing) wasn’t too bad, so i pulled the trigger on this over the sapphire sandwich.

kkocan72,speedmaster,"fist time with a speedmaster for speedy tuesday.  picked up this speedy date 3513.30 last week and have been wearing it quite a bit.

liking it so far as it is a different looking speedmaster from all the rest. the silver on silver gives it a dressy look and it has a small (39mm) case that is also thin enough to fit under a shirt cuff.  yes i read all the reviews and know it has had some critics, but i would say if you have a chance to pick one up go for it, its different from all the other speedys out there.

one quirky feature about this watch seems to be the  valjoux movement.  i read some reviews that it is fairly noticeable when the rotor winds.  from what i read it only winds the watch in one direction, so if you happen to move your hand just right it free-wheels in the other direction.  the first few times it happened i actually thought for a second i had my apple watch on and was getting an alert.  i quickly became used to the spinning though and don't mind it at all. 

one thing it is missing for me is adjust ability in the bracelet as there is none other than removing links.  probably going to pickup an aftermarket strap to try out on the watch and give it a new look/feel.",2020-02-04 16:19:39

for those unfamiliar, this is a dark side of the moon edition with a special call out to the apollo 8 mission, which was the first mission to see the “dark side of the moon” or the “far side”.  it has the traditional 1869 movement to match that of the speedmaster professional which was worn on this mission, with mechanical wind only.  the full ceramic case is just beautiful with a moon surface laser etched dial.

DragonGloves,speedmaster,"for the 10th watch added my collection, i had to do something special for my first $1,000+ watch. bought from a private seller across the world who i am now good friends with, i picked up the speedmaster 3220.50.00, a highly underrated 40mm chronograph. running an automatic omega 3606 (valjoux 7751), it has a triple date complication, 12 hour chronograph, and a 24 hour hand in the running second subdial. it currently runs at about +12 seconds a week even with the chronograph engaged. 

i think it is less recognized among speedy collectors because of the chronograph layout, but the functionality of the complications and the smaller case size make it fantastic for everyday wear. like any other speedmaster, it looks good on any strap, but i cannot take my eyes off it with this vintage leather strap. 

i highly recommend this reference to anyone considering a reduced, it’s a great price for how much watch you get, and is a comfortable and functional daily wear. the rest of my collection has had a lot of shelf time since receiving it. i would go as far as saying it is the perfect timepiece for a ‘one-watch’ collection.

delugs-straps,speedmaster,"10 jan 2017 was the date that the first speedy tuesday watch was released. i wasn't into watches at that time and missed out on getting this watch from the boutiques. but 3 years on, the hype is still real and i finally managed to source for one on the used market a few weeks ago.

it's truly such a beautiful piece, firstly with the reverse panda dial and secondly the brushed case. although this doesn't come with a bracelet, it doesn't really matter since the speedmasters are such strap monsters. really loving my st1 and hope to keep it for the long term. i'm really sucked into the speedys and hope to be able to get a panda dial one soon enough - maybe the mitsukoshi mod ones!

edit: wow, went to bed and woke up with tons of comments and even a gold award! thanks to the kind stranger that gave the award, it’s my first ever :d

to answer a few of the questions: this photo was taken in my bedroom, with one speed light bouncing off the wall to the right, shot on a sony a7rii with a 90mm macro lens. the lighting just came together perfectly on this shot, and yes it was post-processed slightly to get everything looking just right. the strap is from my site [delugs](http://www,delugs.com). this photo was actually shot for a new strap that i’m about to release later in january, made from a leather called dakota, so it’s not yet available for sale. i won’t go on more about it here, but if you’re interested feel free to pm me or follow on [instagram](http://www.instagram.com/delugsstraps).

once again, thank you guys! i will try to get more photos like these of the various watches i have.",2020-01-11 13:04:24

as far as leather straps go, i think it looks good and performs extremely well--if not better than cowhide and calfskin. the shell strap feels cooler to the touch than normal leather and does a better job at wicking away moisture. it also seems just more resilient against water and general wear and tear. i hope to see more shell straps around this sub in 2020 :) 

the strap on speedmaster reduced is horween amaretto shell, the wallet is color 8 horween shell, and the key vault is natural horween shell.

here's a picture of my speedmaster professional taken way way back in july from my holiday to canada. this was taken at summerhill pyramid winery in kelowna, bc. however, i was more interested in my watch than the wine. (this was part of a tour which didn't have an alternate activity). the rest of the trip was certainly more exciting with hiking, rafting and zip lines!

anyway, this was my favourite picture i've taken of my speedy all year, the light looked really good. i'm hoping to take more and post over the next year as a sort of new years resolution as it's something enjoyable, despite not being a great photographer!

the watch is the “correct” hesalite crystal steel back. it’s been getting considerably less wrist time since i got my breitling chronomat last year, but it’s one of those watches in my collection that i would always keep even if i rarely wear it.

the gloves are the dent’s of london “fleming” glove. i’m a huge fan of the world of james bond and daniel craig’s bond is probably my absolute favorite version so far. i love so much of the styling they’ve done for him and i’m eagerly awaiting “no time to die.”",2019-12-25 20:50:07

Major_Burnside,speedmaster,"well it’s been 2 weeks since the arrival of my speedmaster racing and i can officially say i’m obsessed. there’s only been 1 day in that period that i’ve worn a different watch and i was still thinking about the speedy the whole time. i can’t believe i let the size keep me from buying this watch for over 2 years, but i’m very happy i finally convinced myself to pull the trigger. the shape of the case and the improvements to the bracelet make it comfortable even after a full day of wearing it. the 60-hour power reserve adds some additional piece of mind if i do end up putting it down for a day or two. the chronograph is very useful (always been my favorite complication) and the action of it feels so good. but most importantly…it photographs so damn well! i think it’s a combination of the ceramic tachymeter, boxed sapphire crystal, and unique dial texture that just make it really pop in pictures.

tooktheduck,speedmaster,"i've had my eyes on a speedmaster for so long. this was a huge year for me, started a new job, turned 30 and just found out i have a baby on the way. figured all of that coupled with the 50 year anniversary of the moon landing made for a pretty good case to take the plunge!

i changed my mind several times throughout the entire research/buying process as to which model to get. one of the requirements i had in my new timepiece was a clear case back, so that removed the hesalite option (which proved to be hard when i actually went to try them on as i loved the hesalite model!). i also wanted a leather band as i already have a carrera with a silver steel band. in the end, the metal bracelet felt so much better so i went with metal bracelet, sapphire sandwich. no regrets, and i look forward to handing this beauty down to my new baby one day  - after i get plenty of years of enjoyment out of it, of course.

Pit-Viper-13,speedmaster,"are you talking about vintage watches with a cool history? mudu definitely has a storied history. every single watch they sold was made in switzerland by a really shady company, smuggled into england, and sold in pubs and back alleys to avoid the post war taxes on imported goods. smuggling them in and selling them on the streets was literally their business model. 

gruen was an american watch manufacturer with a long history. 

lots of cool soviet era watches are floating around too. i think some guy supporting his family by piecing together soviet watches he found and selling them on ebay is a cool history for a watch. 

if you are talking about modern watches with a cool lineage, the moon watch definitely has a cool back story. i really don’t like the direction they went with the speedmaster skywalker though. it got the speedmaster name from its tachymeter bezel, so can it really be a speedmaster without one? however, it is current kit for eu astronauts, and suni williams wears one in many of the pictures of her floating around. so can it really be an omega built for space without being a speedmaster? 

rolex daytona panda has cool history because of steve mcqueen. 

breitling navitimer has a cool aviation history.

panerai luminor has a cool movie history. 

seiko has a cool history in the quarts segment, first quarts watch and started the quarts crisis.

# the apollo instruments’ dsky moonwatch is way more than a novelty toy

i don’t know if you have heard this, but the omega speedmaster was the first watch worn on the moon. of course you knew, because that is perhaps the most repeated marketing story in the history of watches. and i love my speedy, so i let them fly. what is interesting, however, is that very few watches decided to capitalize and moon and space exploration after it. well, here comes apollo instruments with the dsky moonwatch and the connection with space exploration is clear as day. mostly because the entire watch from this newcomer brand is an exact replica of the display and keyboard (dsky) of the apollo guidance computer (acg), the primary computing interface used by apollo astronauts. 

while this initially looked like a fun toy to me, a slightly deeper dive revealed an actually well put together watch, albeit different than anything else. the case is made from billet 316l stainless steel with a ceramic coating, measuring 38.1 x 44.2 x 13.05mm. it features a micro-oled display, a keypad with tactile micro switches enclosed by hermetically sealed keycaps, and even custom led light color filters that make the warning lights match the glow of the original computer. 

but like i said, this is a serious endeavor. so the folks at apollo didn’t just stick a chinese digital quartz watch module inside. no, they actually developed open-source code to run the watch, code that’s actually based on the original apollo software code developed for the lunar module. so now the watch features basic stuff like count-up/down timer, alarm, and stopwatch, along with time zone adjusting via gps. but you also get fun stuff like original apollo mission operations, like the “gps-driven p66 landing routine, v35 lights and display test, power down and standby routines.” also, the watch can be connected to a computer-based spaceflight simulator, where wearers can input the same commands used by apollo astronauts. and if all of that is not enough, you can upload and run their own code on the watch via a micro-usb port on the rear of the device. oh, yeah, and the team at apollo says they have included a proprietary i/o port that will connect to future products, including “breadboard interfaces, development enclosures, and robotic systems” and “an enclosure replicating the main chassis of the original apollo guidance computer.” come on! 

you can still pre-order the apollo instruments dsky moonwatch and orders are expected to ship in q1 of 2025. this is certainly not a watch for everyone, but it’s so unique i had to write about it. the price is also higher than you would expect when you first see it, but quite rational when you see how much work has gone into it. the dsky moonwatch will set you back £649, split up into a £240 deposit and £409 balance. see more on the very fun [apollo instruments website](https://apollo-instruments.com/?utm_source=www.itsabouttime.email&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=grand-seiko-introduces-the-sakura-kakushi-in-rose-gold-mido-adds-green-to-the-commander-gradient-a-pink-mop-dial-for-a-brellum-the-apollo-instruments-moonwatch-is-wild-and-a-new-czapek-trio&_bhlid=7567dd5425b89dd614ab6083e14b45b1508bb2a4). ",2025-02-12 15:42:25

i just treated myself to an early christmas present:-) speedmaster professional hesalite, the hesalite really does make the watch look great from all angles, especially with christmas tree lights in the background:-) i purchased from an omega boutique who were fantastic.  they spent a good few hours talking me through options and after i eventually made my decision they offered me a letter for a complementary first service, an omega golf umbrella, and a large speedmaster on the moon poster. a great surprise and made me really pleased i bought at a boutique rather than a standard ad in search of a discount. my favourite watch to date.",2024-12-14 20:53:33

1. studio underd0g

it’s a good reminder that we shouldn’t take ourselves too seriously. it’s relatively inexpensive, it’s fun, yet i appreciate it all the same. it’s like how we can all enjoy a mcdonald’s apple pie and yet also enjoy a hearty alaskan crab. 

2. omega speedmaster 

the celebration of human endeavour: it’s just incredible that we put man on the moon in 1969. and the motivation? because we can. this particular edition of the watch has neil armstrong’s footprint on the caseback. the watch is a metaphor for achieving our wildest dreams: as long as we put a shit load of effort into it. this was apollo 11… 10 apollo missions had to predate it! 


3. panerai luminor 

i used to think that this watch was hideous with its crown guard. yet the crown guard is a story in itself. guido panerai wanted to make sure people secured the crown before going into water, and he made this massive guard where the flip tab would jab into your skin if you forgot to close it first. it’s a simple, perhaps not so elegant solution for a real problem. but if it works, it works!",2024-11-20 20:23:22
thesliu5,speedmaster,"imo the best parts of the update are the historically accurate bezel dots and speedmaster script, along with the new shaped sapphire. i owned the previous fois for a couple years and my least favorite thing about it was the thick top-hat sapphire that left the “milky ring” around the dial. it’s pretty incredible how close to the hesalite shape they got with this new crystal.",2024-11-14 03:27:56
SuspiciousEggy,speedmaster,i think the dimensions are going to work for many. it’s functionally the same size as the speedmaster moonwatch because the fois has straight lugs. it’s actually 1mm longer ltl than the moonwatch is but i think they similar enough that if you can wear one you can wear the other.,2024-11-14 02:49:36
EinTheDataDoge,speedmaster,only you can answer that question but the new white dial speedmaster certainly isn’t a wrong choice. great for a chronograph in that price range. my wife gave me a budget of $10k and i ended up way below that cause i fell in love with grand seiko at the boutique.,2024-11-13 14:03:29

Reignofstorm,speedmaster,"i have both so i have some experience with these two. i would say that both look great. depends on which one you like better. like you said, it's comparing apples to oranges. all that being said, if i had to pick one it would probably be the speedmaster.",2024-11-02 13:49:27
momofukuyou,speedmaster,"santos. i have the older 1861 reference, and i stopped wearing it within 3 months of purchasing that thing. i haven't worn it in years, but i still can't seem to let go of it because it's just nice to have in a collection. 

not sure about how the 3861 feels, but the 1861 is a pain in the ass to wind. it takes forever and my index finger even developed calluses from winding it daily. you have to wind it daily until you feel it stop. if you try winding it every other day, there's a chance that you might just forget and it will run out of power reserve. the design is timeless, but like many other moonwatch owners, you will get bored of it. it takes 1-2 minutes out of your day just winding it. you could probably wind it faster if you roughhouse it, but i would not recommend that. some people wind it back and fourth in both directions, but in my experience, it does not wind the watch any faster than just winding it in one direction. btw, i have very strong fingers. 

i also own a santos (medium). it had a longer honeymoon period than the omega, but i still got bored of it. at least its an automatic though, so i have more reason to put it on than i do the speedmaster. the santos you are contemplating on purchasing has a date and a comfy rubber strap. it also has 100 meters of water resistance, which is twice that of the 3861. neither watches are screw down, but you could probably take a dip in the pool with the santos. 

when it comes to heritage both watches are somewhat tied. the santos is the worlds first pilot watch, while the speedmaster is a moonwatch. i would recommend that you get the steel santos large, because it comes with a steel bracelet and a leather strap. imo, much better value than the adlc., which is more expensive. 

  
tl;dr: you will get bored of watches in this hobby. no watch is perfect. when two watches are equal in heritage and beauty, get the more practical one.",2024-11-02 18:19:56

thesliu5,speedmaster,"this is the ck2998 cased straight lug version of the speedmaster. it's ""smaller"" because it doesn't have the crown/pusher guards of the moonwatch. in actuality, it will wear similarly to the moonwatch because it is the same dial and bezel dimensions; lug to lug is slightly longer but the lug width is 19mm.

i prefer the ck2998 models because i like the straight lugs- they go very well with the vintage flat link bracelet and i absolutely love they did a new flat link for this (i am trying to see if they will sell one separately for my current speedy).  also, the new sapphire glass is shaped differently that more accurately imitates the hesalite shape and gets rid of the ""milky ring"" around the dial that it used to have.",2024-10-28 17:58:22

i got married in this watch and plan on passing it on to my kid(s) someday, so it’s a forever keeper. 

matt black dials are without a doubt my favorite style/color of dial for a watch. i love how the grit of the dial shines on this watch, and am looking forward to the indexes to begin to patina and grow that infamous cream color. 

the size is perfect for a person with large wrists like myself. the 42mm case wears  wonderfully on my 7 5/8” wrist. i see a lot of people with wrists much too small for this watch, but it wears very proportionally well for me. 

i only have one gripe with this watch- the bracelet. 
i cannot get that “perfect fit” that alot of people complain about. i have just dealt with it, since i’ve had it. i’ve considered getting a forstner bracelet, but taking away from the “original-ness” of the watch feels strange, so i’ve never grabbed one.

get the bracelet for the new 3861 speedmaster. it's absolutely fantastic and well worth the upgrade. smaller, more elegant links means it's easier to find the right fit, on-the-fly microadjustment, etc. it also makes it a dressier watch, but not *too* dressy.",2024-09-06 20:13:53

LilRick_125,speedmaster,"these are all great points and wonderful watches you have mentioned. i'll give a few points i've learned along the way.

1. **figure out your style** - you share your fathers taste, have a preference for metal bracelets, and you mentioned particular watches you're drawn to. all of these are great to take into account when thinking about what you'd like you watch collection to look like. 
2. **don't buy ""fillers""** - there are certainly more affordable watches than rolex, omega, or breitling that are still excellent watches. your buying habits will inevitably change after graduating and getting a career, but there are still excellent watches in reach of your current budget. aim to by a watch you'll want to keep for a long time even if it requires a few more months of saving. it's a far better to spend on something you'll love than waste money on something you'll regret.
3. **your collection is up to you** - there are no rules to having a 'true' watch collection. perhaps you'll want several brands, maybe only one brand. one dress watch or all dress watches. just build a collection of watches you'll always want to wear.
4. **accessorize** - you may want to build your watch collection around your wardrobe, or vice versa. also play around with different straps and bracelets for your watch. you mentioned a preference for steel bracelets but watches like the speedmaster you mentioned can be absolute strap monsters!
5. **""mistakes"" are inevitable** - instead don't look at them as mistakes but as you figuring your style. you'll fall out of love with watches, or decide you should have bought a \[*insert watch here*\] instead.

try this activity: see if you can come up with 3-5 watches (or more if you want) that you'd eventually like to have, even if they come *after* graduation. try to have different watches like a daily driver, sports watch, dress watch etc.. that you would wear for different occasions. just make sure they're watches you would frequently want to wear.

raustin33,seamaster,"to be honest – i think this is the wrong way to buy a watch.

listing out the brand heritage (this is marketing only) and water specs is such a small part of the story.

you're considering a thin 39mm bb58 and a thickish 42mm seamaster. then a couple chronos, and a horribly ugly longines. 

it doesn't seem like you know what your use case is. maybe it's just fashion, which is fine, but even then these will all wear very differently.

go try things on. something will click, others won't. then buy the one you like the most. 

for me, i'd get the seamaster on rubber.",2024-07-18 13:41:21
leescobar01,speedmaster,"both longines are thick and big and they don’t have the same level of finishing as the tudor or omega. 

between the 2 omegas, i’m leaning towards the white speedmaster as i saw it in person and it was absolutely amazing. the white dial had a porcelain look to it that was very unique. 

the tudor bb58 is a fine watch and having owned 5 tudors, they’re well finished and a great product but the vintage-esque look gets a bit boring after a while. 

so my answer would be: omega speedmaster white
2nd choice: tudor bb 58

kghvikings,seamaster,"- speedy.  i love chronographs, and the black-dial version of the speedy is what comes to my mind when someone says “chronograph.”  i think the white dial is a nice addition.

- seamaster/longines chrono (almost a tie, but ultimately, it would be seamaster) - longines because, chronograph.  it’s nice looking, and the complications are great.  seamaster for overall durability, utility, and quality…and it’s a damn comfortable watch, imo.

- tudor - i like tudor as a brand, but this model not as much as some others.  

- hydroconquest - distant last place. like, i might choose to not wear a watch if this was my only watch-wearing option.  it’s *almost* totally because of the crown/guards.  the guards are awful, imo, and the crown itself is only as long as it is because of the guards.  unnecessary!",2024-07-18 14:05:54

Swamivik,seamaster,"as someone who has bought the first longines, tried on the other longines and own tudor, my advice is don't get the first one.

in person, it is really low quality.  i bought it and returned it right away.

the fit and finish are far below the tudor black bay. 

i posted my review on here years ago. if i find it, i'll add the link.

the hands don't align with the marker, and if you turn the crown it is flimsy as shit.  compared to the bb, turning the bezel it feels quality from how precise each click is.  just looking at the watches, the bb looks luxury a mile away and the longines just look like a normal watch.

the longines i have now is the worldtimer.  but i need to make clear to you that longines and tudor are in different leagues and why tudor is more expensive.  if you ask anyone who has both brands, they can tell you the fit and finsih is not comparable, but on r/watches loads of longines fanboys because a lot of kids can only afford longines so talk up the brand.

go to the shops and try out and you should be able to tell right away.

as to omega, i don't really like their bracelets.  if i have to pick one, i will pick the seamaster but not on the metal bracelet.",2024-07-18 10:10:15

1speedbike,seamaster,"this is the best answer. the question is basically what is the most versatile watch. 

the longines moonphase chrono is too dressy/formal, but is super thick and wears like a hockey puck. the only thin chrono longines makes is the bicompax one in the master collection.

the seamaster is quite large, on a rubber strap, and while it's a fun dive watch, unless you're cosplaying james bond it doesn't work formally.

white speedy is.. fine. it's my second choice. i must be one of the few people who isn't crazy about how speedy professionals wear. 

the hydroconquest just does not impress me when compared to the bb58. it is not in the same class. 

bb58 is very versatile. it's a great size, and wears very well, much better than either the smp or the hydroconquest. it can be dressed up or down easily. it has vintage charm, but is a wholly modern watch. the movement is robust, accurate, and has the longest power reserve of the lot. it has more than enough water resistance. 

nothing against any of the other watches, but the bb58 is the best answer for a ""one watch"" question like this. i have owned every watch on this list except the longines chrono, which i have tried on, and i owned a regular speedy pro though i've also tried on the white speedy. bb58 is the only one i kept long term, and the only reason i sold it is because i bought a 16610.",2024-07-18 12:26:52

(disclaimer- bought it in japan where things are cheaper) i really like my iwc! i’ve wanted it ever since i tried on the xviii but then the xx came with an updated in house (ish) movement and better power reserve. also the slightly smaller lug to lug was needed as it only just fits me. it feels luxury in person, i think it’s really one you need to try in person. (in contrast to montblanc which i’ve found look nice online but feel cheap in person).

i think the omega is now a bit more expensive than that so it wasn’t on my list to choose between. i had an aqua terra on the list, grand seiko spring drive (both felt too fat), or an oyster perpetual (but only had a 41mm available which i thought was too big and flashy).

i like that iwc are not as in your face as other watch brands. i sometimes have to work with people struggling financially so i’d feel a bit of a douche with an obviously flashy watch. also the news reports of people being mugged for their rolex added to wanting something a bit more under the radar.

chanchowancho,speedmaster,"ooh! i’ve owned both a speedy and a mkxviii so can comment here.

i had a speedmaster pro and was an iwc hater:

“why would i want an overpriced iwc when stowa, laco, and even companies like steinhart exist. those are all top tier!”

then one day a dealer was selling a preowned iwc mkxviii on bracelet for $2k so i thought i’d give it a shake.

i take it all back:
- fit and finish is astounding. it’s beveled in all the places the others are not, the brushing and details and edges are an order of magnitude better than the others.
- the dial details look much finer than the competition.
- i took it into my watchmaker for a looksee after i purchased it, and he was very impressed when he popped off the caseback. i have no idea what i’m looking at there so cannot comment 😂
- bracelet is incredible, cartier-level quality, it has a micro-adjust button built invisibly into the polished iwc logo which i didn’t even notice for three days! it’s gently finished on all the edges and almost feels more like a heavy fabric than metal.
- the speedy is lovely, but all the edges felt sharp and sore and machined compared to the sublime iwc bracelet and casing.
- the iwc wore very thin, and had finer proportions compared to the stowas and lacos and steinharts i’ve handled - the latter especially was laughably clunky-looking compared to an identically sized iwc. (although it’s very cheap so not a fair comparison)

my thesis is that iwc are like rolex. they take unassuming designs and execute them amazingly. they have the budget to work on minor details that other manufacturers do not. 

sadly i swapped the speedy and the iwc for a 36mm explorer i and regret it every day. i’ve flicked off the explorer i and am looking for a mkxx to replace it.

QuietNene,speedmaster,"dude, look at the movement.

the iwc xx has calibre 3211. thats 28800 beat rate and 120 hours (!) power reserve.

the speedmaster pro uses 3861, which has a (very sad) beat rate of 21600 and 50 hours power reserve. and speedy is a chrono, which should be at least 28k and better 30+k. the modern speedy barely wins out over its 1957 forebearer, which ran at 18k beats. so today’s speedy is a technological marvel if you’re impressed by  computers that run on vacuum tubes.

this is like comparing a ferrari to a toyota, if those cars cost about the same price. it also makes the mark xx a pretty impressive value. you’re getting better movement here than almost every rolex except daytona (and even then, mark xx has double the power reserve).

Baridian,speedmaster,"as someone who previously owned a modern reduced, which has a chronometer certification, date, column wheel and automatic winding, i have to say the movement features aren’t the thing you’re paying for. 

the main benefits of the speedmaster are that it’s pretty thin for a chronograph owing to the manual winding, and it has an incredibly good dial. no date hole, matte black dial with minimalist painted hour markers, very tightly packed subdials that don’t eat any of the hour markers, and matte white hands. 

the speedmaster professional has one of the least busy chronograph dials ever.

all of this being said, i was already into watches before i bought them, and i'm not going to deny that they generated more interest in watches and created new fans.

ichris2019,speedmaster,"you are viewing the moonswatch entirely wrong. it was never meant to be a swatch branded omega, it is an omega branded swatch. it’s a test driver watch. it’s meant to get people who might never have known the omega speedmaster exists to want one, and judging by the sales of both it worked. swatch did not make it to appease youtubers and journalists expecting a list of usual specifications they’ve assigned to a “good” watch, they made it the exact same way they’ve made all of their chronos since the 1980s, just in a different shape. 

is it a “good” watch? depends on what you’re looking for. it’s not gonna be an heirloom piece that’s for sure. but it’s also not gonna disintegrate the second you put it on your wrist like some people are acting. the reality of the moonswatch is it’s fine. that’s all it is. a good looking watch that will be fine so long as the buyer knows what they’ve got. the idea that swatch was genuinely attempting to democratize luxury and offer an omega for $250 is incredibly naive. it’s just an advertisement, and no one’s forcing anyone to get one.",2024-03-23 13:33:01

i've never seriously looked at a speedmaster in all my years of collecting, primarily due to its ubiquity (i tend to acquire independents and less mainstream brands).

when omega announced the release of the white dial speedy pro, however, i found the aesthetics irresistibly attractive. everything from the applied indices, the dash of red and the shade of white presented by the lacquer comes together to form an extremely sharp timepiece.

i'm so fond of it i'm contemplating the regular speedy with hesalite just to complement the watch.

i’d say go with gs. the speedmaster is an amazing watch but i think it’s just too hyped and common now. with gs, you’re getting something special and uncommon. not to mention you’re buying into top tier japanese engineering, at a fraction of the price of equivalent swiss engineering.",2024-03-11 08:47:36
LucasDeTe,speedmaster,"both on my wishlist.  
but, the gs looks better on your wrist sizewise.  
maybe try the speedmaster 38? that may have the speedmaster features and looks, but fits nicely in your ""smallish"" wrist (mine is 6.3in, 16cm, and i'm on the same boat).",2024-03-11 13:07:18
syst3m1c,speedmaster,"the omega is a classic icon. if it matters to you, it is the most likely to be recognized or provide 'clout.'

the grand seikos are finished a little better and certainly have unique and creative dials. spring drive, as well, is amazing tech and well worth adding to your collection.

that said - the speedmaster by far has the better bracelet.

WestguardWK,aqua terra,"if i were comparing gs to omega i’d probably compare to an aqua terra. for me, hard to compare the speedy with the gs’ they’re just so different.

that being said, i agree with others that the 42mm speedy looks to big. might want to look at the 40mm “racing” versions (not currently being made but made recently, can still find them i think).",2024-03-11 14:50:55
Zamboni4201,aqua terra,"they are different watches.   

the speedy is a better daily.  the gs watches have more…presence.  

i went thru this 2-ish years ago.  i wanted to like the speedy, but i liked the aqua terra 38 in the new “shades” colors more.  the soeedy wore just a bit bigger.  i think i might like the fit of a racing or an older reduced more.  and they aren’t quite as iconic as the moonwatch.  i struggled with that.  

the at shades new colors were delayed.  and delayed.  i still want one.  i’ve seen 3 of them… but i really want to try the terra cotta, and they’re almost impossible to find.  asked the ad to order me one, and they 

meanwhile, i was narrowing down my gs choices.  
i knew that for my first gs, i wanted a spring drive.  it took awhile.  i eventually chose an sbga413 shunbun over the snowflake.  it just stood out to me more.  

it is amazing.  the dial.  the zaratsu polishing,  the sweep seconds. 
and accurate.  holy schnikes accurate.  mine runs +2/3 of a second per month.  

the gs clasp could be better.  no microadjustment, just 2 half-links.  i made them fit me before i paid.  
and i walked around the store for 10 minutes.  i didn’t want to be annoyed with a bad fit.  and fit, it did.  
luckily, i’ve never wanted or needed any adjustments.  i think the lower weight titanium is a factor.  

for you?  you have to decide.  

from the picture, it appears that you’ve had all 3 in your hands.  

which appeals to you more?   

good luck with your decision.",2024-03-11 16:39:56

keep in mind, you don't have to purchase on the first visit. try on. leave. think on it and discuss with whomever you brought with you.  who knows? maybe you'd be swayed by an aqua terra or a 300m. full disclosure: i own both of those. love them. i do not own a speedy. i tried one on and i did not like it. it looked tiny to me in comparison to the two other omegas that i do own. i have tried on a 57 and felt it had more presence than the moonwatch. for me, my next omega purchase will be a 57.

Zanpa,speedmaster,"they are both very nice watches. if he wasn't disappointed by the size of the longines while trying it on, and it's the watch he has wanted for years, i would definitely choose that one.

for your first question: yes, a thinner and smaller watch will absolutely be more comfortable to wear. you forget it's on your wrist a lot more easily. that longines isn't fitting under a shirt cuff. the speedmaster will be more versatile. i would say if he plans on wearing only one watch all the time, and also wears suits and such often, the speedmaster will probably be easier to wear.

for servicing, pretty much any modern watch won't need a service more than every 10 years or so (or sooner if something goes wrong with it obviously). 5 years is an incredibly conservative low estimate. both watches are chronographs, which are usually a little more expensive to service than a time-only watch (simply because there are a lot more parts in the movement). also, some people simply don't even bother servicing their watch until it needs a repair, because oftentimes the difference in price between a service and a repair isn't very significant (in part because the watchmaker's labor is the biggest cost in this). but if you want to keep a watch for a very long time, regular servicing will ensure it won't break early and parts won't wear out.

for the crystals, there is a difference in cost, but also in looks. the sapphire comes with a transparent back, which allows you to see the pretty nice omega chronograph movement, while the hesalite has a solid caseback. the hesalite is the more ""vintage"" look, since it uses the same kind of acrylic crystal that was used for the old speedmasters used in space and on the moon. hesalite scratches a lot easier, but you can also buff out the scratches easily.

as far as the old vs new speedmaster, the previous version used a long-running chronograph movement. the new one has been updated, most notably by the addition of omega's co-axial escapement. it's a neat thing in terms of horological nerdiness, but doesn't really change how the watch functions for the user.

also wow the people here are really quick to just say what *they* want to have and completely ignore what you said your fiancé likes. those comments are... something else.

a little sidenote too: the speedmaster isn't going anywhere. the model is an absolute cash cow for omega, they make millions of them, and in 10 years you will 100% be able to walk into an omega boutique and buy a brand new speedmaster essentially identical to the one today. this probably won't be the case for this longines.",2024-02-14 11:28:48

Herby81,speedmaster,"speedy 100% - it’s an iconic watch. 

the newer version of the speedmaster does have some nice updates. my favorite is the bracelet, which is super comfortable. but that could probably be purchased down the road if wanted, and fitted to the old version. even still, absolutely nothing wrong with the older bracelet. 

hesalite vs sapphire is a very common question and you can probably find a lot of info just by doing some searches on here and google. i’ve owned both and can’t really say i have a preference as i see benefits in both. hesalite is more true to the original for the speedy and is cheaper to replace if/when needed. it does scratch more easily but buffing it out is no big deal. the steal caseback vs the exhibition caseback is also more true to the original, and i think it’s more comfortable. that said, i’m the kind of person who does like to look at the movement occasionally. (sidenote: having an exhibition caseback can be installed on the hesalite model if someone really wanted it). sapphire doesn’t scratch nearly as easily. so many people prefer that, especially on watches they wear often/daily.",2024-02-14 14:04:07
Redwoodsilouette,speedmaster,"speedmaster, it's a perfect casual and dress watch. can be worn with a suit just fine if you want or a button up and jeans. it is a manual wind watch so it will have be wound daily and some people enjoy this as almost a moment of zen and stillness.
as far as hesalite vs. sapphire. speedmaster purists will say hesalite, it's an acrylic crystal and does have the tendency to get more scratched but it can be buffed out. sapphire is much harder but doesn't have the luster like hesalite, it can scratch but it's very difficult to do.",2024-02-14 14:09:45
Uwumeshu,speedmaster,"price difference on the speedmaster comes from an upgraded movement (1861 pre-2021, now 3861), see comparison videos to figure out if it's worth the extra cost. service prices are listed on the longines and omega websites, omega will be around $850

the longines is a chunky one, sliding under the cuff is gonna be hard. crystal choice depends on your preferences, hesalite is more true to the original moonwatch and will offer better clarity while sapphire is much more scratch resistant. if you do get scratches on it the hesalite will buff out much more easily.

you should also look at tag carrera glassbox (no bracelet on the newer model though) and zenith chronomaster. the tag's movement lags behind omega's despite similar pricing but it has an incredible blue dial. zenith's movement imo is better but most models will cost more than the omega, and it'll be far more wearable for smaller wrists",2024-02-14 02:36:42
ZhanMing057,speedmaster,">the longines weighs 178g and 17mm thick

that's a lot of weight and thickness for an every day watch. 17mm with flat sides will not fit under a shirt cuff. the thickness of a modern speedmaster is also marginal, ideally you want something closer to 10mm, but it's a good compromise.

&#x200b;

>upgrades to the movement make it so that it doesn't need servicing for 10-12 years (is that credible?!) and didn't mention the associated cost.

if he wears it every day *and* plans to take it into water, i would stick to 5 years. if not, you can stretch out servicing to 8-10. for an only watch, i would service with omega for the peace of mind.

&#x200b;

>any thoughts on the sapphire crystal version vs. the hesalite crystal version? is the sapphire crystal worth the $1k difference?

i personally don't see the point of a plastic crystal unless the moon watch legacy factor is specifically important. but, if you're going pre-owned, there are dozens of speedmaster references. if he likes the blue, why not a [blue dial](https://www.chrono24.com/omega/ref-31193445103001.htm?man=omega&refid=31193445103001&showpage=&sortorder=1) speedmaster, or even something like the [blue side of the moon](https://www.chrono24.com/omega/-----44mm-30493445203001----id32833774.htm)?

edit: there's also the [apollo 17](https://www.chrono24.com/omega/speedmaster-professional-moonwatch---apollo-17--id31881835.htm) which is 42mm with a blue ceramic dial, and i think much better finished than the longines.",2024-02-14 05:39:37
Obvious_Wizard,seamaster,"the flyback - look at it. do not be scared off by its heft, its size and its girth - this is simply a marketing ploy to shoo away lesser men. this is a proper watch that doesn't need to squeal about going to the moon (allegedly). be bold and buy something intimidating. if he can't handle it the marriage will never last. 

the omega might seem like the obvious choice but look at it. remove the factoid about it going to the moon (allegedly) which omega goes to great lengths to scream in your face about everywhere and it's dull as dishwater. it's just a black chronograph easily aped by pagani design, bulova and the moonswatch and he will be asked if it's a moonswatch.

as for anecdotal evidence as to why you shouldn't pick the omega, every omega owner i've come across (excluding goldeneye quartz seamasters who all seem to have been decent folk) have been insufferable douchenozzles. are you really prepared to spend the rest of your life with an insufferable douchenozzle?",2024-02-14 13:47:45
Budilicious3,aqua terra,"the speedy is an absolute timeless design in the history of all watchmaking. theoretically, the co-axial movement should prolong the service intervals to nearly a decade which imo, makes the 5 year warranty kind of pointless. i personally grey marketed (no factory warranty) my aqua terra after realizing this with my speedy.

also get the sapphire, the 3861 is the most unique movement. an open caseback and manual wind means no rotor, so you can see it in all its glory. the only other watch i could think of is a patek philippe that has a similar open caseback but costs like 5-10x more.",2024-02-14 11:08:51

b3ry1,speedmaster,"just my opinions.

1. the movements in the two are quite different. the pro has 3861 and the 38 3330. the 3861 is manual, cam, lateral clutch movt, and 3330 is automatic, column wheel, and vertical clutch. in short, 3330 is more technologically advanced, the 3861 is more beautiful.
2. i went for sapphire and i love it, it's good to see a manual chronograph movement. but if you are a space nerd and need to wear the exact spacegoing speedy, take the hesalite.
3. honestly i would recommend buying secondhand for any omega watch. but the ad offers discounts too, at least where i bought.
4. the two are honestly two very different watches. my recommendation is to buy the pro first: it is the most 'basic' model of the speedmaster family. i actually started out with a speedy and swapped it out for an speedy automatic.

hope this helps.",2024-01-16 20:41:52
Jkspepper,speedmaster,"good question! i just don’t find them interesting enough outright as a single watch or if it works with my existing collection.

they focus on dressy-sport watches but are either too big for dressy (subs, yachtmasters etc) and too shiny for sport watch use.  i.e. the daytona, i’d rather wear my speedmaster

the classic op with colourful dials or the and explorer models in a mid-size case (~36/7mm) - as a daily, it may work but i have baltic and omega again.  for evening wear, perhaps.

the day-date is the one that i have been considering but again, if it’s not jubilee bracelet with fluted bezel, then it’s the same proposition as an op.  if it is jubilee and fluted, i’d rather use the money for something more subtle such as vacheron overseas in 37mm or a lange.

also need to factor in where i live - asia.  rolex are so common because everyone wants one, which means they are massively price gouged and the hoops you need to jump through to get one.

however i do see them as an excellent proposition for people with smaller collections.  they make an excellent 1/2/3 watch collection due to their versatility as mentioned above, the op/day date is a perfect one watch propositions for someone who can’t afford or can’t be bothered with multiple watches.",2024-01-17 02:14:35

Shoulderpress5,seamaster,fair point. i haven’t used the aafes sales on omega yet. i did leverage their sale when i bought my seamaster though and had the ad come within $100 of the price the exchange had it on for. i’m also dropping a warrant packet at the moment as well so maybe if i get picked up for that the rolex would be the answer but i do really dig the moonwatch since it is very different from what i already have.,2024-01-04 16:37:49
Shoulderpress5,seamaster,just went to the watch shop and they are a dealer for both rolex and omega. think my choices are now between the sub and the moonwatch. love the bracelet on the moonwatch but the only one they had on was the hesalite version and not sapphire. i like the sub for the pure durability factor and military history but am iffy since i already have the black dial seamaster. told them to put me on the list for the sub with date but def looking more into the moonwatch,2024-01-04 22:18:29
Shoulderpress5,seamaster,i do agree with the jubilee. i made it clear at the ads that i would want it on a jubilee as i find it looks more dressy. have yet to try on the speedy with new bracelet but i did find the jubilee to wear much nicer than the bracelet my seamaster came with.,2024-01-04 17:06:21
NavyTim1991,seamaster,"that is awesome. i got a seamaster at, blue dial, for my 30 year retirement. i knew i wanted a seamaster, just seemed fitting for the navy. didn’t go diver because looking for something a little more dressy for the occasion. plus omega is symbol for ohms, which reminds me of my former electronic technician days (yes, nerdy 🤓).  the watch as a whole reminds me of a big part of my life that is now behind me. 

retails for $6,300 and i got it for $4,700. thought it was a great deal. after though i discovered the world timer, i wish they carried that!  such an awesome looking watch i think. at the end of the day, i’m very happy with what i picked.",2024-01-06 01:48:39

thesliu5,seamaster,"i don't know about ""slept on"", they're just not as popular for two reasons:

1) the most popular chronographs are the ones in the 3-6-9 subdial configurations- daytona, el primero, universal geneve compax, apro chronos, etc.  the 6-9-12 layout is just not as popular

2) cause moon landing

also servicing a moonwatch (at least the pre-coaxials as i have no experience with coaxial ownership) is generally cheaper (at least at the certified indies that i've been to) than the automatics because as manuals, they're less complicated; you don't have to deal with all the additional (and constantly moving parts) in the autoworks. the one that was the most complicated were the ""reduced"" with the dubois depraz piggyback chrono module. those were easier to service by completely replacing the the chronograph module.

secondary pricing is mostly subject to collectable a watch is.  vintage moonwatches with the 321 movement are pretty pricey, but vintage seamasters with the same movement are not nearly as expensive because waaaay fewer people collect them.  nothing inherent about the automatic movements justifies a lower price, except that the aforementioned piggyback chrono movement tends to depress prices of the reduced pieces because everyone factors in an expensive service on those.",2024-01-03 22:31:06

GundamManiac,speedmaster,"i totally understand that perspective and it's something i've considered.  in general i'd agree with just saving up for the thing you really want.  in this case though:
* this is a shared hobby and collection with my wife.  a real speedmaster equivalent would really entail getting at least two speedmasters, one for each of us.
* hand wind mechanicals aren't for everyone.  my wife for instance likes the low fuss of quartz and its higher accuracy compared to mechanicals.  
* the fun of the moonswatches is that the entire case and dial are different colors from traditional watches, not just a colored strap on a black-dialed steel sports watch.  my wife for instance really likes the baby blue uranus, the pink venus, and the bright yellow sun.  there just aren't really good analogs for those in the real omega speedmaster lineup.

i guess my point is, this is a shared activity and collection between my wife and me and i'm happy to have this to share with her.  that also means it takes both of our preferences into consideration, and the real omega speedmaster just doesn't offer what my wife is looking for.  if it came down to an either/or situation, eg either keep the moonswatches or sell them all to go towards a real speedmaster....well, the real speedmaster costs more and benefits only myself, whereas the moonswatches even in total cost less and benefit both my wife and me so i'd stick with the moonswatches.  i would love to one day maybe add a real omega speedmaster to the collection, but it would be in addition to and not instead of the moonswatch collection that brings joy to both my wife and me.",2023-12-18 19:45:05

GundamManiac,speedmaster,"i've been slowly collecting watches despite trying not to collect watches.  the latest watches i've been collecting have been moonswatches (gotta catch em all!).  i know they're controversial, but i still enjoy them, partially because a) i like the idea of a relatively affordable (compared to a real steel speedmaster) version of the moonwatch that is ""officially sanctioned"" if you will, and also because b) my wife likes the fun colors and it's a collection we can share and build together.  so with all the not-actual-moonwatches we've been collecting, the bulova lunar pilot naturally piqued my curiosity when i found out about it.  the size was the main thing holding me back, but i figured i'd give the newer smaller 43.5mm 96k111 version a try when i saw it on sale for black friday.

i was worried about the size, but in practice i feel like it's just about pushing the limit of what will fit on my just-under-6.25-inch wrist.  the height doesn't really bother me given that my typical daily watch is a seiko 5 gmt.  

honestly i've really been enjoying the lunar pilot.  i thought i wouldn't like the ""melted"" pebble-y look of the curved lugs (especially relative to the beautiful sharp twisted lugs of the speedmaster design), but in person i find that i actually quite like it.  this probably also helps the watch feel like it wears smaller than its actual size since the curved polished sides are harder to see when viewing the watch face on.  speaking of the face, there's just something about that vast flat crystal and the tachymeter bezel placement underneath it that is very satisfying, along with all the stepped layers that make up the face.  the paddle ""rocket fin"" pushers are super satisfying to click and the subseconds totalizer and smooth central seconds timer hands are a pleasure to watch.  i really appreciate how silent the movement is too, especially compared to some other watches i own like certain moon-related swatches.   

the only downsides so far, which aren't really downsides to me since i always planned on replacing the straps, are that the included strap/bracelet options don't fit me.  the bracelet is ever so slightly the wrong size for me (removing all the links except a half link makes it too loose where it just slides forward of my wrist bone onto my hand and hangs off the back of my wrist most of the time, and removing all the links entirely makes it so snug that it digs in uncomfortably when my wrist expands while opening my palm) and the included two-piece nato-style leather strap is just slightly too loose for my tastes since the watch keeps shifting and hanging off the back of my wrist like the bracelet (to the point that punching an extra hole wouldn't help because that would be too tight, and i cant punch a hole where i actually want because there wouldn't be enough material to support it).  i've currently got it on a third party single piece leather nato which i'm happy with, and i have a lunareplicas nasa-style velcro strap on order.",2023-12-02 03:32:14

how is your lunar pilot holding up?  the only longevity concern i have with it compared to other watches is that exposed raised crystal.  i've been trying to be more careful and conscious of my watch wrist location, especially around things like doorways since i'm so clumsy.",2023-12-02 03:40:36
alek_hiddel,speedmaster,"i have one tiny little nick at the edge of the crystal that happened about 6 months into own it.  at the time i thought i'd die, but these days it's honestly not noticeable at all.  in 5 years of ownership i've changed the battery twice.  once due to genuine age, and once because i accidentally activated the stop-watch when putting it in it's case and didn't notice until the next time i got it out a few months later.  

one funny thing about the lunar pilot, is that after you've stopped and reset the stop-watch feature on it you'll actually almost feel like the speedmaster is the cheaper version.  resetting on the lunar pilot you get to watch the hands race back around the dial to 0, but on the speedy it's a spring mechanism that immediately jumps back in place.

StxrStruck,speedmaster,"no problem, happy to help! here’s some us dealers that i’ve either purchased from myself, know someone who has, or are pretty universally regarded as good to do business with: 

the 1916 company (big dealer with multiple physical locations, formerly called watchbox, shoutout to the legendary tim mosso), shreve, crump, and low (physical location in boston, great reputation), the marin vault (only on chrono but good feedback and pretty good deals), watch exchange company (good reviews, good deals), european watch company (physical location, great reputation)

there’s a ton more out there but i always check listings from these dealers first. another pro-tip: listed prices on chrono are more of a starting point for negotiation, especially in this market. make a smart offer and it’ll probably get accepted. also, if a dealer doesn’t have the exact watch you’re after, give them a call or send an email asking if they can help source it for you. if they don’t have a speedmaster in stock for example, it’s not hard for them to get one",2025-05-02 01:49:20

TheInsidiousExpert,speedmaster,"your post is inspiring.  i’ve always considered it to be essentially impossible for myself to acquire a speedmaster moonwatch, which i’ve wanted since my early teens (was a big space nerd).  not always, but definitely after finding myself income-limited for the rest of my life. 

i once was a functioning/contributing cog in the gears of society (was a military bomb tech/eod), but fate changed that.  unfortunately i’m one hundo percent broken (va disability) with permanent/total unemployability.  not complaining because the funds do cover all essentials with breathing room, and many people aren’t so fortunate.

i basically wrote it off because it would take multiple times the length of time you accomplished your goal in, but your post has me thinking about it and feeling a bit of positivity about the idea of trying for once.  

obviously the task would be easier if i went for a well cared for preowned rather than new.  new is $7-$7.5k correct?  what would a good but fair amount be for a nearly mint preowned (with proper certification/documentation) be?  

any general advice would be appreciated.  details and specifics aren’t necessary because there’s years upon years of saving lying ahead if i can commit, so no telling how market availability and price will change by then.  

thanks, and congratulations op.  i love seeing people enjoying satisfaction that they earned through hard effort/discipline/patience.  enjoy it!",2025-05-03 09:32:47

iampatata13,speedmaster,"buying my first speedmaster in japan this june – boutique or pre-owned? moonwatch vs. co-axial 38mm?

  
hey everyone,

i'm heading to **tokyo and osaka this june** and i’m planning to buy my **first omega speedmaster** while i’m there. i'm super excited, but also a bit torn and would really appreciate advice from those who’ve been through this — or have shopped in japan.

# 🛍️ where to buy – boutique vs. pre-owned?

i'm still deciding between buying **new from a boutique** (with full warranty and the experience) or going **pre-owned** from one of japan's many reputable second-hand dealers. here's what i've found so far:

# boutiques (brand new, full warranty)

**tokyo:**

* omega boutique odakyu shinjuku
* omega boutique ginza (nicolas g. hayek center)
* omega boutique roppongi hills
* omega boutique nihombashi mitsukoshi

**osaka:**

* omega boutique shinsaibashi
* omega boutique osaka takashimaya

# pre-owned / trusted second-hand shops

* **komehyo** (shinjuku, ginza, osaka)
* **jackroad** (nakano broadway, tokyo)
* **ginza rasin**
* **watch company tokyo**
* **yukizaki** (online & physical)

i know japan is known for top-tier second-hand watch shopping — clean, well-maintained, often full set, and sometimes great prices. but the boutique experience + tax-free new watch also has its perks.

# 💭 the watch itself – moonwatch vs. co-axial 38mm?

i’ve always been drawn to the **speedmaster professional moonwatch** (because, of course... moonwatch), but i recently tried the **speedmaster 38 co-axial** and it honestly fits my wrist better. i have a smaller wrist, so the thinner profile and compact case just feel more comfortable.

here’s my question:  
**is the moonwatch still worth it for a first-time buyer even if it wears a little large, or is the 38mm co-axial a smart and underrated choice for someone like me?**

a picture with the co-axial 38mm in white.

YourKingslayer,speedmaster,"1. what types of activities does your father-in-law like to do? if he's more outdoorsy/spends time near or in water, something like an smp 300 might be a better bet than a speedmaster. if he already has a ""diver"" or all-purpose watch, a speedmaster is a great watch. i own an smp300 and two speedmasters and like both a great deal, but would personally lean towards speedmaster. while omega watches are far more available than rolex, a few models are still tough to get a hold of unless you have a purchase history with your authorized dealer/omega boutique. the silver snoopy and rhe calibre 321 (ed white) are both examples of watches that you can't just walk in the door of your ad/ob and buy. you need a bit of a purchase history as these are limited production pieces. i would recommend a classic speedmaster professional, on the bracelet. there are two kinds - if he is at all a space nerd, i'd go the w/ the hesalite model. if he doesn't care as much about the speedmaster's space lineage, the sapphire sandwich w/ it's display case back is the better bet.
2. there are a few different retail options for buying a piece in person. if you live in a major city, chances are you will have an omega boutique nearby. even if you don't, there's almost certainly a jewelry/watch store that is authorized to sell omega (authorized dealer). there is a bit of added enjoyment to picking up a piece from a physical location imo, but not everyone thinks it's always worth it. there are online options as well, but when you're buying online it's important to keep in mind you're buying the seller more than the watch (assuming you're not just using omega's website, in which case you wouldn't need to be worried about the watch being real/undamaged). chrono24 is probably the biggest site i would trust for secondhand/gray market watches.
3. negotiations are a bit down to where you're buying it. if you get it at an omega boutique, don't expect any discounts. maybe they'll throw in a strap and some light swag. if you're going to an authorized dealer, there's the potential for some discounts (10%ish) - although with impending tariffs i'm not sure that's so much the case anymore since existing inventory in the states will be more valuable from a total margin standpoint. chrono24 also has ""unworn/like new"" pieces that can carry discounts, and to some extent you can suggest prices and negotiate - but i imagine they are thinking of their existing inventory as more valuable in light of tariffs as well.",2025-04-23 05:56:34

Chance_Fisherman5108,seamaster,"i may be a bit biased as i went for seamaster heritage 300, so i would say go for that! stunning watch, the hour jump is cool when travelling. the movement is arguably the best in the group you have picked (two barrels and power reserve). 

i have no issues with the bezel, it is anodised aluminium to help with the scratch resistivity. i haven’t picked up any scratches yet and it mostly my daily. 

do i miss the date, a little but my phone is in my pocket if i need to check. this is also very much a personal preference as a lot of people prefer not having a date. it would bother me a little having to remember to adjust on months not 31 days long or if i don’t use the watch for a few days and need to set it correctly. 

that speedy is also very nice 😄",2025-04-19 23:51:13

10 mins after i was at the omega boutique with the watch and the box, buying straps. they asked me if they could check the watch serial number and the warranty card, i let them look at it and they told me both were original omega. they asked me how much did i pay, i told them all the true. they were very nice to me and provided as good service as if you buy the watch from them.

they will run it through verification in dayton oh to ensure everything is as posted.

if you have questions hit me up.

the local ad i use - at first used to try and say that omega do not like to discount their products. so i showed them the deal i had found and asked nicely if there was anything they could do to allow me to buy the watch as i would like to buy at a local dealer rather than at an online reseller.

for the moonwatch you are looking at i got a 15% discount and a free strap valued at £420, so that was more than good enough for me to buy locally. now they just give me 15% automatically as i have a history with them. my last watch was an aqua terra, so i got 15% off it and a nice wooden watch box thrown in. i do know that 15% is the maximum discount they will give me, if i tried for any more there would be no deal.",2025-04-10 05:54:39

if he only showed you the one in your photo i would definitely suggest looking at the new shades models, as well as the models with the lines on the dial. truly stunning watches. but like i said, i like the understated look - i’ve never been a fan of the diver aesthetic. 

also what did surprise me was that in person, i may prefer the white dial speedy. black is iconic but for some reason i think it looks better in photos - in person it is is a lighter black, almost grey maybe, whereas in photos it looks like a deep rich black dial. ",2025-04-07 20:48:59

you can’t go wrong with seamaster or speedy. i’d encourage you to start thinking about which you want first, because eventually you’ll have both. ",2025-04-07 10:29:51
delectable-mango77,seamaster,"*holy crap*

it’s funny, that’s exactly what i’m doing. i will end up grabbing one with a metal bracelet and then also getting a rubber one just so i can switch it up. the speedy will probably end up in my collection one day in the future. but i want a decently nice watch that i’m not afraid to travel with. 
i have one other high end watch that i love but i am almost too afraid to wear often. 

i feel like the seamaster is perfect to fit every box i need checked.",2025-04-07 00:40:47
delectable-mango77,seamaster,"the big thing here is that none of them were sized to me, they all were quite large lol.

delectable-mango77,seamaster,"the white dial / black bezel seamaster is definitely on my list.

- removes risk of damage from courier to your location
- omega boutiques don’t offer discounts anymore, however if you ask they will likely throw in a complimentary service certificate, which depending on your watch movement can be significant.

gettothatroflchoppa,seamaster,"if you're not looking for highly in-demand models, private sales/grey might be best: a lot of models take a hell of a hit in depreciation as soon as they leave the ad/boutique. for example, i'm in canada and a sedna gold seamaster here, all in with taxes, etc. retails for \~$11k from an ad. on the 2nd hand market, with a warranty card a few months old and maybe some shop wear on the clasp you can find them for $8k or less.

for more in-demand stuff, or just wanting to shop new (eg: gifts, etc.) i slightly favour boutiques as they seem to have more inventory and models to try on and i've had positive experiences dealing with them. you pay a premium for that maybe, but service and inventory are solid. 

ads i find can be 50-50: i've encountered ones who either have to wait ages for inventory (or pretend to be rolex and make you play games for in-demand models) and i've encountered others who are super-friendly and will go out of their way to help you, but ultimately are at the mercy of omega for what they receive and when.",2025-04-02 14:07:28

therealscrudgy,seamaster,i had the same two watches in mind for my first omega. before committing to the purchase i was leaning more to the speedy. when i went to actually go and choose one the seamaster talked louder to me on the day and i took it home a happy man. didn’t regret it for a second. the speedy sapphire sandwich was my second buy and i still think it was the correct buy order for me.,2025-03-31 13:57:34

peromp,seamaster,"i was in love with the speedy forever, and was looking to buy one a few years back. but as the purchase was getting closer, i started looking into the seamaster. to me, it stood out as a more robust watch. the water resistance, the sapphire crystal, the modern movement which is very anti magnetic (i'm not sure if modern speedy's are anti magnetic), plus the date are all big pluses.

the speedy is perhaps more classy looking, it is after all a 60 plus year old design that doesn't look old or retro, a modern timeless classic. the seamaster looks a bit more bulky and contemporary, but as james bond can attest to, it wears well with a suit too",2025-03-31 21:47:17
Texas_Mike_CowboyFan,seamaster,"i got the speedy recently for my first really nice watch. kind of wish i had gotten the seamaster. it's a little more blingy and noticable. although the speedy is understated and there's nothing wrong with that. i just wanted something that someone might notice and strike up a conversation about. no one has noticed my speedy, or no one has said anything at least. ymmv.",2025-04-01 00:28:02

Jax_Alltrade,speedmaster,"i had a similar experience recently. i went to a rolex ad and they didn't exactly treat me poorly, but they pointedly ignored me while i browsed the various watches they had. given that this is rolex, that means i spent my time looking at iwcs, breitlings, and pretty much every brand except rolex. seriously anything above a datejust is vaporware. the portugieser with the black dial looks awesome, btw, so thanks rolex for showing me how good iwc is. i can't say they were rude, but they certainly weren't friendly.

then i went to the omega boutique on the other side of the mall food court. i don't own an omega; i was wearing a grand seiko golden snowflake. the fellow working there greeted me, complimented my watch, asked me what i wanted to see, and enthusiastically showed me 5-6 different models ranging from a sedna gold at to a moonshine speedmaster, all manner of different bands, etc. we chatted for about 10-15 minutes about watches, gold alloys, etc. he answered every question i had and was completely respectful despite the fact that i straight up told him i was just browsing. it was a completely different experience than the rolex ad.

look i'm not saying i hate rolex, and i'd never say a single watch brand is superior to all others. what i am saying, however, is that omega treated me wonderfully and actually had watches for me to see. i mean ffs if someone is going to spend 20-50 grand on a watch they probably want to see the damn thing on their wrist first. i've wanted a speedmaster for years, and the more i think about my experience the more i realize i want to go back there and buy one.

omega does it right.",2025-03-31 04:17:59

Jax_Alltrade,speedmaster,"i'm not sure, at a certain point exclusivity gets so restrictive that people stop caring. out of sight out of mind i guess.

i see a lot of really expensive cars; i live in palm beach county. i see a lot of lambos, but not so many ferraris, which means i think about lambos, not ferraris. i don't really have much interest in sports cars, but if i were to buy one it definitely wouldn't be a ferrari. that says something, because when i was a kid ferrari was the dream car of everyone i knew, including me. i could get one now if i really wanted it, but i don't, and i'm certainly not going to try to ""earn"" the right to pay someone hundreds of thousands of dollars. that's just absurd.

5-10 years ago a particular mint released limited runs of 100, 188, and other very small numbers of 1ozt gold coins with extremely high quality engraving. the idea was that if you could get one then you could flip it, or you could wait and it would become a collector's item. they were extremely exclusive. i bought one, spent about 3 grand for a ""nautical ounce"" when it was worth less than 1800. they were absolutely on fire throughout every stacking community i was part of. now they're basically unknown. why? because they were so exclusive people forgot they existed. if you squeeze too hard then you strangle demand.

rolex isn't likely to do this anytime soon, but how many men were gifted a rolex by their father for some milestone? how many of them are now unable to do the same for their son? some day i want to own an all-gold, brand new watch. i always wanted a rolex, but now? well, why suck up to an ad when i could just walk into an omega boutique and buy whatever speedmaster i want? not only could i get the exact watch i want, but i could try it on first and see if i really like it.

soflapistole,speedmaster,"i would recommend going back and trying it again at some point. i obsessed about getting a speedy as my first milestone watch for months, but when i finally got the chance to try one it, it just didn’t hit the way i thought it would. for me, a big part of this is the size. i had been wearing my lunar pilot a lot prior to going to the ob, so the speedmaster felt tiny by comparison. the simplicity of the watch  is another factor, when you see it online it looks amazing as it photographs extremely well, but it person it lacks some of the detailed craftsmanship on the dial of other $8k watches(this is a big part of the speedy charm and part of what makes the design timeless). last for me is the bracelet. i have read nothing but great things about the bracelet, but for me it felt too light and almost fragile, didn’t really like the thin taper on my wrist. all this being said, a month later i am trying on watches again and thought, what the hell, let me try the speedmaster on, and i actually liked it a lot better. those factors still exists sure, but lowering my initial expectations allowed me to appreciate the watch for what it is, a timeless and elegant design, with a history that captivates one of man’s greatest achievements.",2025-03-29 10:47:01

when i tried the omega in person, i honestly felt the opposite of what i expected, looked amazing online, but in real life, it just didn’t click for me. too thick, kind of dated, and that bracelet really felt past its time. choosing the tag also saved me around $2k, which definitely doesn’t hurt 🙂",2025-04-23 22:46:17

Falx__Cerebri,seamaster,"sorry in advance for the long read. 

my dad has a carrera and autavia from like 05 and used to daily a formula 1 quartz from like 06-07 up to about 2023, never had any problems with mine until i broke the f1 trying to repair a broken part on my own. i’m not a very good indicator since i take really good care of pretty much everything i have even if it’s a piece of shit seiko/swatch/tissot or a god tier casio.  

from my experience the older tags feel just as solid as any mid tier swiss (longines/sinn/tudor/breitling). zenith, rolex and omega 100% feel one tier above on pretty much the entire model lineup but it’s not a night and day difference as people like to act it is, and the extra cash is not worth it at current market prices unless you can get a deal from japan. my old rolex submariner felt like a freaking tank (subs are seriously tough way more than the other rolexes bar the explorer), the speedy is a bit more fragile due to the chronograph mechanism so i’m much more careful. i don’t care if i get downvoted to hell, the seamaster is just not as tough as a pre 202x’ submariners (before they went gold) no one can convince me otherwise, i had a planet ocean which i never loved.

two of my friends are jewelers so i’m constantly exposed to a fair share ap’s, vc’s, rarer rolex’s, the odd hublot/rm’s here and there so i tend to base of how they feel/look instead of what online trolls think. stuff like vc and ap blows rolex and omega out of the water it’s not even close but i would never buy any and wearing them for a day or two didn’t feel any more special than my speedy or seamaster its all placebo and snobbery. 

i can’t speak to the current state of tag so yeah it’s a bigger gamble than ever before but lvmh have been trying very hard to revamp the brand especially since that recently leaked f1 deal which means they are going to heavily invest, i’d go for it if you get a warranty and heavy store discounts which are super easy to get. 

tldr; passing on to the little ones: omega without a shred of a doubt i can’t stress this enough. if it’s just for personal use and banging it up go for the tag if you get a good price and warranty, omega will retain its value better so just cement that into your decision. in my opinion: wait a few months for the market to inevitably collapse and buy something even better than these two for about the same prices. cars and watch markets are currently a joke",2025-03-26 02:16:27

it’s manual so you will need to keep winding it. unlike for example a seamaster which is automatic, you can wind it once then just wear it every day.

also, if you are used to a constantly running seconds hand, this won’t do that unless you keep the chronograph going.

i generally advise an smp 300 or aqua terra as a first omega but buy what appeals to you aesthetically.

-Slartibart,aqua terra,"service it once right before warranty runs out then you won’t need to worry another 5-10 years.

it’s manual so you will need to keep winding it. unlike for example a seamaster which is automatic, you can wind it once then just wear it every day.

also, if you are used to a constantly running seconds hand, this won’t do that unless you keep the chronograph going.

ProfessionalFarmer70,speedmaster,"thanks for the recommendations. 

i plan to order it from a grey market dealer, it’s discounted 19% right now. the white face is not available, nor is it my preference so i will probably stick with the black face. didn’t realize the white face held its value better but that’s okay. 

unfortunately i fell in love with the watch before i realized it was not an automatic. i tried to sell myself on something else, but i keep coming back to the speedmaster.  

can you clarify the part about the second hand? the way i understood it is that the big second hand is constantly going, but there’s another small second hand that you need to activate using the chronograph. once again i’m new to luxury watches, but plan to start building a collection. please excuse my ignorance",2025-03-06 21:52:13
YamOrSweetPotato5,speedmaster,"i'm not telling you how to wear your watches, but you'd be surprised how almost no one notices your watch. even more so with an all black dial that gets referenced and duplicated by every watchmaker. you'll be under the radar unless you want to talk about it and show it off.

sidenote, there's nothing wrong with showing it off - enjoy the watch and the success that comes with owning it. the speedmaster is an incredible watch with a great story to go with it.",2025-03-06 23:07:18

the bezel material is aluminium, so there will be a lightening of the material over time, which i welcome.

ErichPryde,seamaster,"definitely one of the more uncommon issues. currently the two big ones are clasp failures in the seamaster line and issues with the last couple of applied letters in ""professional"" on the ceramic dial smps. 

this was likely the result of a re-sizing error- these screws are factory threadlocked so it's more likely someone unscrewed it. not sure why they would have though.

Safe_Speed_3231,speedmaster,i would really recommend trying the speedmaster on in person. i like you wasn’t sure about the size as i have a 6.5 inch wrist. the speedmaster professional is a 42mm but definitely wears smaller than what you would think. i went for the speedmaster pro with the crystal back and i love it. congrats on making your bonus!,2025-03-02 03:40:25
Slow-Link6842,speedmaster,"congrats on your accomplishments!  

i bought a speedmaster 38 yesterday, thought i would get the moonwatch, but i really fell for the 38 once i compared both. 

definitely go to a boutique if possible, just to try on the most variety. they are likely to cover the most styles.  i live in nyc and could only try on “my watch” at the boutique (38 on steel)

from there, shop around for the best price. if buying used, make sure have a solid reputation. 

have fun!",2025-03-02 11:05:33
Jesseitsmyname,speedmaster,"congratulations on the bonus and the speedmaster is a great watch. one thing i wanted to add is that you can indeed save money going gray but there's advantages to ad, boutique purchases.

if this is your first luxury watch you may want the fanfare and celebration of buying it at a boutique.....bring your so, have a glass of champagne or whiskey, enjoy them fitting the watch for you. you won't get a discount, most likely, but you can ask if they'll throw in a strap and deployant clasp. you also build history with them for any limited pieces in the future.

ad is similar to boutique but may offer a ~10% discount and the history built is across watch makers, not just omega. the fanfare and booze selection may be limited.

gray market is the absolute cheapest, and is entirely transactional. my 3rd and 4th watches were gray....but my last purchase was boutique so there's a time and place for everything.

nevertheless, whichever watch and route you choose, wear it in good health!",2025-03-02 17:40:22

read the posts from username archer, he seems to be an omega certified watchmaker from canada, reading many of his posts over many different forums, i've come to the conclusion that he's one of the best watchmakers out there.

for example, have a look on his posts regarding the servicing of the co-axial escapement, it's simply fascinating.

my most expensive omega was $12,800 (speedmaster black black). it’s the very opposite of flashy. and, in fact, that’s the part of omega that appeals to me: they aren’t ostentatious and they’re reasonably priced. they keep good time and, at their price point, they aren’t criminal magnets.

i like omega, but unlike you, the speedmaster was never on my radar. i pretty much thought it was a boring looking watch and have tons of other choices in front of it. my wife, however, surprised me with a the moonswatch as a stocking stuffer after we watched that ""fly me to the moon"" movie over the christmas break (where omega featured prominently.) i don't wear it a ton, but i did put a new strap on it (the oem one is hot garbage) and its a fun watch on the wrist out on the weekends. in fact, i am now considering getting a speedmaster at some point simply because the watch looks so good.

ByronicZer0,speedmaster,"i dont think it is underrated. i just think it's not popular for some very understandable reasons.

the size is a barrier for any people. especially since large watches are currently no longer in style and the normal speedmaster is already a large watch. and the much more sporty styling makes it less flexible of an option vs a speedmaster, daytona etc. the old speedmaster racing models were always slower sellers vs the more conservative/mainstreamm speedys. couple that with a higher price and you have a perfect recipe for a niche watch that is not a mainstream sales hit.

still a cool watch. just has some headwinds that make it not relevant to many folks.

plus, we are nerds. most people walking into an omega boutique are not. they want a great looking watch from a great brand. they think great accuracy should be a given, not necessarily an additional selling point. so spirate isn't quite as compelling as an upsell",2025-02-18 15:42:00

i’m not really sure why anyone would buy an ultradeep over an smp300 or a planet ocean (other than ‘because i can’) and when i see them they are usually worn by men who really need you to see what they have on wrist. there is nothing subtle about them and most will never see salt water or any kind of depth greater than a few metres.

you can’t compare the mass appeal of the speedmaster, the most iconic chronograph of all time, against the very limited niche appeal of the ultradeep, they are so very different in every way. the speedmaster has been in production since 1957 against the ultradeep’s comparatively more recent production.

W2WageSlave,speedmaster,"you have to understand that the markup on a luxury watch is between 35% and 40% and that leaves a lot of wiggle room for games.

if a watch retails for $8,000, the ad might have paid less than $5000 for it. it probably cost omega $1,000 to $1500 to manufacture and package it.

""bundling"" and other machinations occur to move product out of ads. moving metal is key to keeping your franchise. problem is that everyone wants a snoopy, a submariner and a gmt, but nobody wants a 34mm ladymatic or that pearlmaster gathering dust at the back of the safe. you might even have a glut of ordinary speedmasters tying up your capital. a typical ad probably has several watch brands on their line card, and if they are lucky, rolex or another brand with some high-demand products.

as an ad you can end up stuck with ""sh1tters"" that nobody wants. you can let those keep piling up in the safe, eating into your working capital, or you can figure out a way to get your money back - which is where the gray market comes in. you have to be careful not to annoy your manufacturers, but within reason, especially at the lower end, it really doesn't matter what you do. they just want to move more product.

if i have a rolex and omega/swatch group franchises, why sell a $10,800 gmt to a single customer, when i can sell the gmt at msrp bundled with several tag's, oris's, hamiltons, and even omega's at a small discount to the gray guy with several hundred thousand (or millions) in working capital? the gray dealer will jack the rolex prices and clear out the junk - sometimes at a small loss, so they can free up their capital and come back for the next rolex piece. it's the cost of business to get the profitable pieces.

most watch brands don't really care. richemont sometimes does, and has bought back product, just to destroy them: [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/18/richemont-destroys-nearly-500m-of-watches-in-two-years-amid-buyback-policy](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/18/richemont-destroys-nearly-500m-of-watches-in-two-years-amid-buyback-policy) rolex on the other hand are probably absolutely giddy with the market dynamic. it makes the value of their watches seem even higher, while simultaneously depressing the value of other brands.

blackmikeburn,speedmaster,"having the warranty card means less than it used to. 

my dealer registers the warranty with omega at the point of purchase - it’s in the system before the watch gets fitted to your wrist. the warranty card gets a sticker that can easily be peeled off - it’s just a reference. even if i lose the card, my warranty is in omega’s system, and i don’t have to produce a warranty card for service, as the dealer looks up the warranty status online. note, this is an ad, not an ob. 

the reason they are cheap on gray market is 1) no official warranty, and 2) markup is huge at msrp. gray dealers are buying at wholesale from other outlets (like ads with extra stock), and then marking up to something between wholesale and retail. 

if you have a good purchase history with an ad, and you have a good ad, you can usually get pricing/discounts that rival gray market, but from an ad and with official omega warranty. i just bought a speedmaster 57 for $7300 after tax; that watch is $9500 retail. that’s less than jomashop and many other gray market dealers. but i have a history and spend there, so they keep me happy. ymmv.",2025-02-11 20:26:39

you can go to the grey and save, but depending on what kind of buyer or collector you are, some need to care about spend history as i was, the reason i was able to grab a snoopy at the boutique and of course at retail. if you want to save real money, don’t buy a new car at the dealership, i sure don’t.",2025-02-04 05:05:08

i daily a 3539.50 speedmaster reduced second generation, and love it. fits me perfectly and looks and feels great.

the speedmaster 38 is a more dressy and blingy version of the reduced. more shine and polish, which is a matter of taste if you like it or not. i did not like the notches on the bezel, and also the increased thickness. i will admit the coaxial integrated movement is better. 

the main criticism of the reduced is the movement, it is a piggyback chronograph movement on top of the regular movement. implications are that the buttons are slightly offset, and also it is harder for some independent watchmakers to service. omega charges the same to service it as any other steel mechanical chronograph.",2025-02-03 04:49:47

quantumfella,speedmaster,"i asked chatgpt and even it knows that something is off lol

1.	unusual offer to “strategize” – omega boutiques and authorized dealers do not typically offer a strategy for acquiring watches. the mention of helping clients “advance past other people on the list” sounds questionable and potentially unethical.

	2.	insinuation of preferential treatment – the message suggests that the sender has a way to bypass waitlists, which is not how omega officially operates. this could indicate an unauthorized resale scheme or an attempt to manipulate the system.

	3.	overly apologetic tone – while customer service messages may include apologies, the repeated apologies here feel excessive and somewhat scripted, possibly to lower skepticism.

	4.	grammar and wording issues – while not overly problematic, phrases like “help you to strategize acquiring” or “advance past the other people on the list” sound unnatural for a professional brand like omega.

this message might be from a reseller or someone trying to gain trust for a gray-market deal rather than an official omega representative. if you’re considering acquiring an omega snoopy speedmaster, it’s best to deal directly with authorized omega boutiques or dealers.",2025-02-01 04:37:01
jumpinghourhand,speedmaster,"hot take:

luxury watch brands should all have at least one “aspirational” piece that requires a buying-history or special circumstance to acquire.  from porsche, to ferrari, to rolex, to louis, to omega… the exclusivity factor is important for the brand to retain its luxurious image in the minds of consumers.  an easily acquired speedmaster costs $7,000. the median household income in the united states is $80,000.  after taxes, that puts the cost of one of omega’s flagship models at over 10% of the median household’s net income.  that’s clearly a luxury item that omega sells a boatload of every year- they are able to sell a device that simply tells the time and “times stuff” by maintaining a brand image that exudes luxury.  to do that, you need to have some stuff that’s “hard to get”.  

a terrible side-effect of this, in my opinion, is that a “true enthusiast” may be pushed out of the market (or the hobby entirely) as a result of not being able to spend as much money as another enthusiast.  another side-effect, of course, is the entrance of flippers and scalpers that take advantage of the situation and find a way to acquire the “hard to get” pieces simply to re-sell.

i’m on both sides of this.  i’ve got a strong omega ob buy-history.  very likely to be allocated a snoopy in the next few months (i’ve been offered one already, and turned it down for some personal reasons…asked them to call me again in q1 or q2 of 2025, and i have a high conviction that they will…they told me they would).   on the other side of the coin, i love rolex, too.  i desperately want a pepsi on oyster, but i can’t get an ad to even look me in the eye when i ask for one.  i have no meaningful buying history to compete with the rest of the population that wants a pepsi.  is that frustrating?  yes.  do i believe the ad when they tell me that rolex can’t figure out how to mass produce the bezel?  my guess is that they’ve figured out how to produce enough to keep the pepsi “hard-to-get” and could hire more people/build more machinery to pump them out if they wanted to…..but they don’t want to.  simple as that. 

to answer your question directly- the response you got means that they aren’t going to sell you the watch unless you buy at least one (probably 2 or 3) pieces from them at retail.  you could do that, and get yourself a snoopy.  if there’s another omega piece that you really want, you might simply ask “hey, if i buy xyz, could i get a snoopy on the same day?”.  worst they can say is ‘no’.  

you could also buy the pieces they recommend buying, sell them (at a loss, almost guaranteed), and then buy your snoopy…. but, obviously, by the time you do that, you could’ve just gone “grey” and probably gotten into the watch for a cheaper price.

the choice before you is an annoying reality.  your other option, of course, is to flip them the bird and move on….if they produce the 50th snoopy until a 60th edition is released, the price is very likely to settle out at or below retail on the secondary market.  my ob hasn’t heard a peep about a 55th edition, so that’s entirely possible if they don’t discontinue it this year.",2025-02-02 14:44:17
Fabulous-Bit4775,speedmaster,"it’s a little odd to say that they let you buy the snoopy without buying anything else whilst at the same time saying that you bought the speedmaster at the same time. :-)

but you’re 100% right when you say that it’s up to the boutique to decide who to give it to and why. there are no specific rules. so it’s really about how to put yourself in a position where the boutique wants to give it to you - and in the vast majority of cases buying other watches helps with that. but it can also be because they think that you will buy more watches from them in future - not necessarily that you bought more from them in the past. 

but probably in your case there is a big element of luck - you were in the right place at the right time and they didn’t have someone else they wanted or needed to give the watch to.",2025-02-01 09:12:57
FearOfSpheres,speedmaster,"i bought my speedmaster out of a professional dealer in japan in chrono 24.

i first researched my watch specifically to see what i’m looking out for. chrono 24 has a guarantee. then i looked at the reviews read them. lastly i looked at the watches my dealer had in stock i mean they were selling $100,000 watches and had great reviews i didn’t doubt authenticity. it came with a box that was 25 years old and sure looked like it.

you can always take it to omega right as you recieve the watch to authenticate if theres any doubt on the watch.

Bridge_Too_Far,speedmaster,"nasa purists don’t like anything with the speedmaster name on it that has specs different than the ones that went to the moon. the automatic movement and 38mm case size is deemed inauthentic. not saying they are right, just how they feel. 

however what they conveniently forget is that before nasa even looked at a speedy they were designed and made for racing car drivers. one could argue that the speedmaster has just as much heritage in motorsports as lunar space missions. obviously the space stuff is always going to get the limelight as it’s completely inaccessible to normal people. anyone with a car can race. 

i personally couldn’t wear a racing due to my 8” wrist but i respect that there are many who have a smaller wrist and would prefer to wear the 38mm, just as i prefer the 42mm.

AlphaMike1090,speedmaster,"**happy speedy tuesday!** i recently purchased this speedmaster professional on chrono24 for just under 4k all in. i’ve done this several times with mostly positive results, and thought i’d post my experience and possibly help someone who is looking for their first speedy. while i was looking for something from the late 80s/early 90s, this info applies to \*most speedmasters with 861 and 1861 movements, and indeed many neo-vintage omega watches. some possible faqs:

**info on the watch?** this is a 42mm, handwound, tritium-dial speedy, reference 3590.50.00 from 1993. it shares the same case as the 145.022/3570.50/311.30 and their variants. it houses the beautiful, copper-coloured caliber 861, the precursor to the more commonly known 1861.

**condition?** excellent condition for its age. factory brushing can still be seen on the top and sides. it’s hard to tell if the polished bevels have been lightly re-polished, or if the watch has simply been slid in and out of pockets for the last thirty years. the lume has aged as you might expect, but it’s very uniform and matches the hands (important!). the movement is running strong and within original specs. the bracelet has an acceptable amount of stretch. the watch did not come with box or papers.

**how did i search for it?** i had a budget in mind, and while i kept an eye on various forums and online stores, a tritium dial speedy pro simply isn’t listed for less than 4k and if so, usually in poor condition. i was 99% sure that i had to go through japan. chrono24 offers excellent security to the buyer when buying from a professional dealer, which is why i steered clear of professional dealer’s websites, online auctions, etc. (ask me why).

so, i went on c24, set the parameters for what i was looking for, saved it to my notepad with email notifications for new watches that fit the criteria, and waited. my criteria were simply (insert your model # here) below a certain price. external conditions, b&p, etc., really needs to be decided by you, since japan is well known for taking great care of their watches, and usually make the condition out to be in worse shape than it actually is. once the watch popped up, i confirmed with the seller that all functions of the watch worked correctly. i didn’t really bother with their advertised daily deviation, since the 861/1861 is easy enough to regulate for a hobbyist, but certainly look at that if you’re not comfortable doing it yourself. my watch was advertised at +29 but has been +6 seconds per day for the last week. i snapped it up, and a week later it was on my wrist!

feel free to ask any questions, and since this has been my experience, please share your own.",2025-01-21 15:19:27
nadasuss,speedmaster,maybe i missed the answer to this question.. but what are something you look for in buying from chono24? i seen a few speedmasters but buying from an online source has always been so sketch to me especially with that amount of money.,2025-01-21 15:48:55
cg1308,speedmaster,"i’ve been inspired by your post and had a search on chrono24. i found a couple by closer who obviously have a line in speedmasters. 

i bought a few watches from japan previously and as you commented, they often exaggerate how bad the condition is. something i would consider fair they would describe as poor; which works well for us! 

i guess my concern is servicing. there’s a few on there that have daily accuracy within 10 seconds of true, which i think is pretty reasonable. would that be a fair ballpark for assessing mechanical quality?  i don’t know how much the service runs to…",2025-01-21 18:42:41

in what currency did you pay and how did you buy? regular chrono or via vpn?",2025-01-21 21:12:36
AlphaMike1090,speedmaster,"if you're referring to the watch's condition, originality, etc., then research is the only answer, and maybe a little bit of actually handling the watch. most sellers are happy to provide more pictures, so it's really up to you to make sure that the condition suits you. there's tons of information out there for speedmasters in particular, so make sure that the dial, bezel, movement, and bracelet are correct. compare those pictures to nos watches if you can to determine the level of possible refinishing.

for vetting the seller, experience goes a long way too. starting out, look at the reviews for a seller, and also reviews of chrono24 and how they handle mediation. i can tell you that for the most common japanese sellers, it is a safe process, provided your happy with the watch's condition. moving to other sources and forums is possibly a different topic, although i'd happily answer questions if i can.",2025-01-21 15:58:39

the smp 300m could definitely benefit from a trim, but those watches also have large dials and wide cases. i've got watches that have similar thickness but smaller dials and thus wear 'better', at least for my wrist. e.g. tag glassbox.",2025-05-06 10:15:00

Think_Editor_1054,seamaster,"a few things to consider, before you make the choice. before you buy any watch, don’t compromise because of price. get the watch you want even if it means saving for longer. 
second hand or gray market watches are a mine field, especially with rolex and omega. 

i have several dive watches a planet ocean and a seamaster are among them. my po is my daily driver as it was my first ever luxury watch purchase and my sm gets a fair bit of wrist time. the po has performed flawlessly for almost a decade now out performing its more expensive competitors. 

the po is a taller watch and it gets caught on things like jackets dress shirt sleeves etc. it’s not a low profile watch it’s large and chunky. my sm is lighter and slides under cuffs and through jacket sleeves much easier. i believe both look good in a board room or out on the water and i have gotten complements from executives to bond enthusiasts alike all dudes of course. 

the cost of a standard planet ocean vs chronograph is lower initially. so will be your eventual servicing costs expect around 1k for standard 1.5k+ usd for chronographs. that said the sm may give you a lower cost of entry with amazing specs chronograph or otherwise. 

if you buy a watch on a strap and then decide you want the bracelet just know to order it through omega there will likely be a comma in the price tag.",2025-04-30 14:32:42

TurtlepipeL3N,speedmaster,wow awesome watches thanks for sharing! i’m actually planning to get the new white dial speedmaster next.,2025-04-30 10:17:32
ErichPryde,seamaster,"some thoughts here as someone who has owned both generations of the heritage and an smp-

the first gen heritage is going to be the least expensive of these (most likely). it has an amazing dial- the sandblast really pops in sunlight. in lower light conditions, the hands and silver/white numerals are pleasantly highly reflective. but... it comes with some downsides. the first is that the watch is 14.95mm tall. height isn't an issue to everyone, but the height here is *mostly* in the case. it will catch on shirt cuffs (especially on a nato). it's a top-heavy watch and it wears like one. the second issue is the bracelet- which has male centerlinks that extend the on-wrist lug-to-lug to 54mm from 48mm. it wears big both in height and wrist spread, worth considering if you have a wrist under 7.25"" in diameter. also, those centerlinks are polished, and they show scratches.

moving on to the second generation heritage- this watch fixes all the dimension issues the first gen has. the height is 13.8mm *but* the actual caseback-to-bezel height is just under 12mm- the crystal is much more domed than the prior gen and the case essentially shares height with the smp. the male centerlink is female, so it wears at a true 48mm lug-to-lug. the outerlinks are polished, which are both historically accurate *and* makes the watch age more gracefully than its predecessor. it wears amazingly well, perfect as far as i am concerned and i know people with wrists down in the low 6s that it looks great on.  the sandwich dial is beautiful and has amazing shadowplay, but loses some of the wonder of the first gen dial without the more noticeable sandblast. i genuinely wish they'd kept this feature! also- the bezel moved from ceramic back to aluminum. it's durable aluminum, so no concern there, but has a completely different look than the ceramic bezel does. still, my pick between the first and second gen is easily the second.

lastly, the smp- 42mm bezel diameter and a lug-to-lug of 49.7mm (for this model, slightly reduced vs the date smp) makes it a bit larger than the 41mm x 48mm heritage, and it wears larger. height is essentially identical at 13.8mm and it wears similarly but definitely feels chunkier. the lyred ""professional"" style lugs and scalloped bezel give it a vastly different appearance; neither is better than the other, both are great.  and- while i miss the ceramic bezel on the heritage, the aluminum bezel on the nd smp really helps the dial/bezel ratios look better than they do on the all-ceramic, date smp. and the aluminum dial is just absolutely fantastic. the combination of visual cues really makes it wear well and it plays with light in pleasing ways the all ceramic model can't touch.

i love boats. i love history. i love brunches too, and although i'm more often in outdoors gear than i am a suit, i like watches that can dress up and down. if i was picking two watches off this list it would be #2 and #3, but if i could only pick one it is easily the heritage. it's going to wear better overall, pair with everything, and look great with your boat gear, at brunch with a mimosa, or with a suit. the original seamaster 300 from 1957 aimed to do all of these things and the current heritage does it just as well.",2025-04-28 18:10:29

3. option 2 is the answer. it just has cool retro vibes. if you want to finish the retro look to perfection, i would buy a omega stainless mesh for #2. that combo looks so sick.

i don't see a lot of people talking about the patina on them, and the few who have said it hasn't aged much or, at all. all the patina fans love showing off the aging on their bronze watches, and that seamaster is never mentioned in those threads. so i think we can safely assume this alloy is pretty stable, and will still look pretty fresh for a long time.

sathomasga,seamaster,"you don't mention the specific reference(s), but i'm assuming that ""midsize"" implies seamaster professional 300m such as reference 2561.80. most of the following is true for other references, but -- notably -- the earliest production models of the pre-bond seamaster 200m had a unique and rare high accuracy quartz movement designed and manufactured by omega. omega switched to a standard quartz movement after a few months, so the following also applies to **most** pre-bond watches. (if you do have an early reference 396.1042, you definitely don't want to send it to omega.)

if omega services the watch, they'll actually do quite a lot. some of the following is optional if you ask them not to, but by default:

- update the movement to the latest revision. omega does not service quartz movements, they simply replace them. and the quartz movements used in these watches underwent several revisions. so it's nice to get the latest and greatest.
- replace the hands with new ones.
- if warranted or requested, replace the bezel and/or dial at an additional cost.
- replace the crown, hev, and associated gaskets.
- replace the caseback gasket.
- replace pins and collars in the bracelet.
- polish case and bracelet if desired.
- perform water resistance check to verify original rating.
- provide a 2-year warranty.

for all intents and purposes, it's like getting a brand new watch. last i checked, local watchmakers in atlanta were quoting around $400 for a quartz service that didn't include nearly this much work. since omega only charges $500, i think the omega service is a relative bargain.

as for authentication, there really isn't much to do for these watches. the serial number should be engraved on the lug at 7:30, though, if the watch was originally sold grey market, that might have been polished out. originality of the movement isn't an issue since, as noted above, those are regularly replaced in their entirety during service. the only potential concern would be if the omega cal. 1538 was swapped for a generic eta 255.461. those are actually the same movement, but omega's has a bit more decoration. you can verify that yourself by opening the case back and looking for an ""omega"" engraving on the coil bridge.",2025-04-19 17:53:22

WatchandThings,seamaster,"on 8900 movement, dual barrel give more power reserve as well as more steady power as the watch winds down(better accuracy at the end of power), jump hour feature is more unique, and the finish is a bit better(example, behind the balance spring and center of the rotor). the better movement and increased depth rating would be the main argument for the planet ocean being higher quality. though harder to argue for that with the smaller planet ocean that uses the 8800 movement...

other than the quality argument, i'd also point to the longer design heritage of the planet ocean. it is based on the original dive seamaster as well as the military seamaster. it feels more like a proper omega dna dive watch, whereas seamaster 300m traces back to the 90s. both part of omega dna at this point, but po has more heritage in my opinion.",2025-03-27 11:33:40

i got this 1980 cal 1332 de ville for £175 last week. it works perfect and is the best quartz i’ve ever had, not deviated a second since i set it when i got it.

sathomasga,seamaster,"if you have a quartz version of the seamaster professional 300m, then the watch almost certainly has a cal 1538 movement. maybe some of the very earliest production units had a cal 1438, but that's essentially the same movement anyway. they're both eta 255.461 movements with updgraded finishing.

standard procedure for omega is to simply swap that movement with a ""new"" one as part of a service. it's not cost-effective to actually disassemble, clean, re-assemble, and lubricate those movements, and it's definitely not worth their time to try and repair one. in theory, they can use their specialized equipment to check if an older movement is still operating within specifications. an okay movement wouldn't be swapped, but anything from 1995, and certainly your watch, will not pass that test.

probably the biggest downside to an omega service is the time frame. it will take several months for them to complete the service.

edited to add: if the timeframe is an issue, you can probably find a local watchmaker that will swap the movement in your watch for a generic eta 255.462 (which is the successor to the 255.461). it's a trivial job that i've done myself as a hobbyist. you'd want to verify that they can source a 255.462 first, though, as that movement is also discontinued, though some suppliers still have a few in stock. note, though, that an omega service will include much more than a new movement. they'll also replace the hands with ""new"" ones; they'll replace the crown, hev, and caseback gaskets; they'll test for watertightness; they'll replace the pins and collars in the bracelet, and should you elect the option, they'll polish the case and bracelet. they may also offer to replace the bezel and insert for an extra fee. and you'll get a 2-year warranty on the service.",2025-03-08 22:46:05

i bought the [heimdallr mesh bracelet ](https://www.heimdallrwatch.com/products/stainless-steel-mesh-band-for-nttd) for $39 plus shipping for my seamaster 300m (same size as my speedmaster sapphire sandwich too) just to make sure i actually like the style, and once i did, i went to the boutique to try on the oem because with the heimdallr i found i'm in between the holes. i figured maybe the oem had different spacing so i could find a more comfortable fit.

nope - exact same spacing, which means i wouldn't get a better fit, just the same fit i have. i didn't mind paying $39 for a strap that fit just ok, but paying 100s for a strap that was great quality but fit poorly? no thanks.

your experience may vary, which is why i recommend you try on a cheaper version first, so you know what to look for in the oem.

good luck!",2025-02-27 21:56:47

but probably the most consistent thing is for a workout program that involves 3 different stations for 20 minutes each for 60 minutes total. the format at each station varies each workout. could be emom, could be 5 4-minute rounds, could be anything. all you know is each station is 20-minutes long. i have a diver i take to each workout just to time the stations, so i know how much time is left in each one. sometimes i’m defeated, check to see how much time has passed, and there’s still 15-minutes left!",2025-02-27 03:16:52

my seamaster is honestly the perfect watch for a dad of young kids.  when putting them down for naps or at bedtime, my smp300 is the perfect tool for the job.  i know that 2.5-5"" is the perfect amount of time for rocking my youngest to sleep.  anything less can be immediate crying, anything more isn't allowing him to put himself to sleep. 

a g-shock with light is too bright and smaller-dialed watches are more difficult to read, especially non-dive watches.

my navy squadron used to have a breitling wall clock in the readyroom. it was fashioned after an altimeter, but didn’t have near the detail of your smp wall clock. and that lume is incredible! the watch i used most as a tool was my speedmaster x-33 moon watch. i spent many years flying f-18’s from aircraft carriers. as you taxied into the shuttle for the catapult launch, there was a guy on the deck who would show you the planned aircraft weight. he would do this by holding up a rectangular metal box with handles on each end. the front displayed numbers which showed that weight. you would signal if the weight was good or needed to be raised or lowered. at night that was done with a flashlight. circular motion meant weight was good, vertical motion meant raise the weight, horizontal motion meant lower the weight. the navy issue flashlight was one of those big 2d cell elbow types, which was snapped to your survival vest. it was a real pain to get it out and use it. most guys carried a pen light flashlight in their flight suit for this purpose. i however, was able to push the back light button on my x 33 and use that bright light to signal the weight board operator with my wrist. it was efficient and cool! 25 years later and the watch still works perfectly. it doesn’t get much wrist time these days, but when i’m feeling the need for speed, i put it on and hurdle down memory lane.",2025-02-28 23:25:28

planet ocean: make it thinner and bring back the matte ceramic of the second generation po. i think the glossy ceramic was great but i love the chic matte design more.

makaveli-313,speedmaster,"good question.  
so after trying them both on, i felt i wanted the speedmaster more... or perhaps if not want but it made more sense to me.   
as you mentioned sapphire, the above picture has the hesalite all wrapped up, but it is indeed the sapphire sandwich the one i want. i love the clarity of the display glass, the clear case movement and the placed logo. 

the salesmen did make me try out the green 300m and i did like it more than the blue wave(not summer blue above) one. it was not bad, not bad at all.. more subtle and easy on the eyes.

as many have said, always buy the watch you like on bracelet, even if you prefer it on rubber or leather; will be cheaper if the boutique doesn’t offer it to you, you can go aftermarket and get something that you like more… buying bracelet afterwards will end up much more expensive, and you’re forced to get it from the manufacturer…

HardUserName2000,aqua terra,"well if you get the battery changed on schedule, a quartz movement will very rarely need to have parts replaced. whereas an automatic movement will need to have parts replaced eventually. 

the movement in the aqua terra you’re after is the 1538, a rock solid movement that omega produced for a very, very long time. speaking to my omega boutique, and looking around online, it seems like the 1538 is still easy to service or replace if (big if) something catastrophic happens. 

whichever watch you choose, i will say omega has probably the best service program out of the major watch brands. they will take almost any old omega and do a really good job, if needed. 

i am not in the watch industry, just a hobbyist, but i’d feel equally safe buying either the auto or the quartz. i own a watch with the same quartz movement from 1998, and it ticks on without any single issue.",2025-04-26 11:52:34

AnyAndAllMusic,aqua terra,i sold mine after a year due to the date setting and scratches. couldn’t look at the thing without it getting a mark on the bracelet and without a winder or daily wear it is just too much to do on the 8900 movement. i only wore it maybe once a week so it got real old real quick. i liked the watch don’t get me wrong but have two other omega i like much more in a racing (it’s date setting sucks as well but is way better) and a po. i feel like a bracelet change and an easier date setting movement would make aqua terra one my favorite omegas i’ve ever owned. just my opinion though.,2025-04-25 14:15:36
RockeThomas10,aqua terra,"the aqua terra is a fantastic choice! you should note that the model in your pic is 34mm and shows up under the “ladies selection” on the omega site. there are also two tone models with sedna gold (omega’s rose gold) in both 38mm and 41mm. multiple dial colors including blue. check out their site.

if i had my time over again and knew then what i know now about watches i likely would’ve bought an aqua terra first.

it literally is a gada (go anywhere do anything) watch. you can wear it with t-shirt and jeans, a suit, board shorts at the beach.

you can run, swim, fly and climb in it. it really is a sensible first luxury watch as you will get so much more use out of it than other watches in the omega collections.

my watch above is the previous generation at from 2018 and was sourced from japan for around $3k usd landed with taxes. don’t be afraid to consider used examples, they are great watches with great movements.",2025-04-17 02:20:01

both at sizes seems to work fine with your wrist, so you can go either way. current trend is to wear smaller and i think that might end up being more timeless size. but the 41mm has the 8900 caliber with the jump hour function, which is kind of unique for non-gmt watch. might be worth considering if you travel often.",2025-04-15 21:30:21

maddog2271,speedmaster,"dressing similarly to you for work i chose a speedmaster back in 2018 and i have been happy.  it is however absolutely not a watch to wear with a suit if you are following traditional men’s fashion rules; note that i don’t follow them and i do wear it with a blazer or suit, but i am just saying.  the speedy is a casual watch.

the reason to choose an at would be better use for “everything” owing to better water resistance and the automatic movement.  if i was to choose an at i would go with the 38mm because watch sizes are coming down and in my opinion the at with the classic lines is better in a sub-40mm size.  also, good luck being “one and done” once you’re in this particular rabbit hole…",2025-04-16 04:41:01

MoccaLG,seamaster,"hahaah you just took the 2 best looking watches

speedy and seamaster 150 - 

* speedy is a little bit more nice and more like a ""technical"" watch.
   *  works always with any strap
   *  but its handwind and hesalite, furthermore no water resistant which are downsides for me.
* seamaster is always working as well
   * works on many straps
   * waterproof and has also a sporty and classy character. 
   * automatic watch and sapphire cristal. 
   * when buying seamaster go for the teak deck versions

i personally would prefer the speedy in looks because there is nothing like this but i would buy the seamaster!",2025-04-16 05:51:00

MALAKANU,speedmaster,"very true...speedy is unfairly costly for the tech it carries inside (cam actuated horizontal clutch) and one can easily get a better one with a column wheel vertical clutch from longines (i have a spirit). 

but having said that...its quite foolish to compare a legend with a punny.

still watch snobs those who talk about column wheel and blah blah just cannot ignore the aura of the speedy. the older tech makes it robust over the column wheel chronographs, which are very fragile, and if one of the columns break a repair in some countries is like impossible (at least in india where i live it is likely to be so). so basically we have to baby these column wheel chronographs.

let me be fair and a bit clearer...in a global population of 8 billion...at least 50-60% of the people know 4 brands....irrespective of their purchasing power .. rolex, casio, seiko and the speedmaster(not omega)...so the speedy has become a generic brand in itself, which sets it apart from the rest of the pack and gives it the status of a legend. no other particular single watch has that credential for sure, maybe leaving a few rolex.",2025-04-16 06:17:39

Joe-Ingles,aqua terra,"i love the sbga413/443 (same watch, just us vs intl serial respectively) nicknamed the “shunbun” - it’s light (titanium bracelet) making it a much better daily driver than the aqua terra and the dial finishing is just splendid being inspired by the japanese sakura blossoms. i would say it looks more white than pink under usual circumstances but if that’s not your ur cup of tea i recommend the slgh005 “white birch” which has one of the most amazing dial textures i’ve ever seen. both are white dials, so if that’s not something you’re looking for go with the speedy imo, but grand seiko spring drive movements are some of the most unique and exceptionally made in this price point. i recommend getting them in japan but reputable japanese sellers on chrono24 have them as well for way below the us listed prices which are absurd. for a darker look, any of the “lake suwa” inspired ones i would recommend as well!

btw i’m also a speedy and aquaterra owner, and while these two were boxes i needed to check, i think having one grand seiko, probably any spring drive movements watch, is a must for any serious collector, despite what people have against grand seiko fanboys.

i have 300m and speedmaster both. if you are debating between the 300 on that bracelet and speed master get speed master. the 300m seamaster is my go to beater that is probably one of my favorite watches over the years.

the bracelet on regular 300 gets a lot of hate but i find it super comfortable. i am actually wearing it now. the speed master is more comfortable but the micro adjust isn’t as much. so it can need link taken out or put in depending on weather. if you don’t have much difference in wrist size the speed master bracelet is better.

lume is way better on seamaster. the lume on speedmaster sucks. but that’s not what it’s for. so it all depends on what’s important. more adjustable bracelet with better lume or more comfortable bracelet with not so good lume. both look great though but the white dials match stuff better and pop more. as you can tell i am partial to the white dial omegas",2025-04-19 01:54:16

i have 300m and speedmaster both. if you are debating between the 300 on that bracelet and speed master get speed master. the 300m seamaster is my go to beater that is probably one of my favorite watches over the years.

the bracelet on regular 300 gets a lot of hate but i find it super comfortable. i am actually wearing it now. the speed master is more comfortable but the micro adjust isn’t as much. so it can need link taken out or put in depending on weather. if you don’t have much difference in wrist size the speed master bracelet is better.

JazzSelector,speedmaster,"the warranty on a new/recently secondhand is international 5 years from original purchase date. so look at the model year.  you are covered from original date on the warranty card. 

as far as i know, jackroad is not an ad so even if it is ‘new’ it was still sold to them. it will be in beautiful condition. older pieces might have been polished which affects resale, they will tell you if you ask them. 

i haven’t bought from jackroad but visiting friends have. they are totally legit and are a larger store which means they have a high level of accountability. 

my experience buying from other stores is that for older pieces (let’s say you by a 2017 speedmaster), they will have a store warranty but that will be voided when you leave the country.",2025-04-13 11:33:43

ErichPryde,aqua terra,"it's fantastic, out of the 6 different omega bracelets i've worn regularly it's easily the most comfortable. it tapers well, has three positions of micro adjustments, the endlink is female on the second gen so it maintains a true 48mm l2l which is nice. 

don't be misled by the case dimensions either, the steel case back on the summer blue actually thins this model out, it measures more like 13.7, 13.6mm on the case back and the crystal accounts for a significant portion of the height and is nicely rounded. it wears pretty close to an aqua terra in size. i'm currently wearing a sapphire sandwich speedy and it honestly catches on my coat sleeve more than my heritage does, probably because of the bezel and crystal profile.",2025-04-08 02:47:00

MindenFlyer,aqua terra,"the first place i saw this setup was at the omega boutique in san francisco. one of the salespeople was wearing the white dial smp with the at straps. i saw it, loved it, and given that i was wearing my white dial at the moment, i bought the setup right then and there. that salesperson said that he sold a ton of them just by wearing his in the store. a few things to note (including your spring bar question):

1. ⁠the setup is not cheap. $270 for the straps. $270 for the clasp. and $93 for each little metal piece that embeds in the strap (omega calls it a “decoration piece”) adds up to $726.
2. ⁠the spring bars to use are the narrower spring bars that come with the nttd mesh bracelet. you’ll want the narrower bars because you need to bend the bar ever so slightly when installing the strap. you put one end in and then you have to kind of push the other end in. i think the part number for the narrower bars is 068stz015766. i can verify that later when my ad opens. i’ve also used the curved bars. but i like the narrow straight bars better.
3. ⁠if you don’t have a preferred omega ad and you don’t mind ordering from one in nevada and having it shipped to you i can help you order the full setup from my preferred ad.
4. ⁠if you do have a preferred local ad i can give you some more detail on how to order the decoration piece. that part seems to throw a lot of dealers off.

finally, here’s a photo of my rio 2016 with the rubber strap from the ultra light aqua terra just for fun!

that said if you're not feeling the love for the aqua terra then by all means learn from this experience and look for something that will scratch that itch...just know that if you buy something that's visually similar on a bracelet but cheaper the only person that'll know the difference is you.

i understand that you would be reluctant to wear it in dangerous situations however. i wear a swatch in sensitive situations.

Weary_Employer_2087,seamaster,"the rolex and omega ads are all owned by the same company in my country. the branches for both brands are situated next to each other, but the experience is the same for me as the original poster. i wonder how the owner’s management orients their workers. if you are assigned to rolex ad, you must be snobbish and tell potential customers that there are no stock and come back after 5 years maybe. if you are assigned at an omega ad, you must be super helpful and attentive to your customer. i always wondered how that works. i know that the salesmen get commissions, because when i purchased my seamaster, the salesman was noticeably delighted. i wonder how the rolex salesman is able to earn any commission.",2025-01-17 07:05:45

the glossy black is blacker than satan's soul,the date window is rounded and somewhat curved and all text is silver and kind of reflective.
it's also really slim and the bracelet with the hidden clasp is awesome.
for 36mm i would go for the constellation 95.
but really buy what you like.
if you like the tudor then buy the tudor.",2025-01-09 18:39:33
B5HARMONY,aqua terra,"i usually go for my personal opinion regarding watches as im the one who spends and the one who wears. however as i am undecided i want you guys to give you your opinion on which is the superior watch. im aware this is a omega subreddit but i still want to see your guys opinion, and know if any of you have had any experience with one of these two watches

design wise i absolutely love these both 36mm pieces. my favourite watch of all time is the rolex day-date 36mm. the tudor shares some strong resemblance to that and does it with a remarkable blue dial that gives me ""stella"" vibes.

on the other hand the aqua terra is one of my favourite designs that omega has ever done. particularly this first generation of aqua terra nails all proportions. its blue dial emits a different tone of blue under different lighting which makes it very unique.

im not certain but i believe the aqua terra is more of a sports watch making it more durable than the tudor's dressy nature. 150m water resistance (omega) vs 100m water resistance (tudor) this might not look like a huge difference but allegedly watches that are water sport friendly are said to require around 150m of water resistance.

case-back and movement. i don't know much about either other than: eta 2834-2 (tudor) vs 2500 co-axial. the positives on the omega that im aware of is the open case-back which is a nice touch

bracelet wise i think tudor takes a fairly unique approach, gives it an 80s vibe that is hard to replicate. however i think the omega bracelet is superior. higher quality, the clasp mechanism is simply superior and it's just beautiful.

tell me which of the two would you add to your own personal collection! if you've read this far thanks!",2025-01-09 09:36:47

OneTimePadwah,speedmaster,"this may illustrate it a bit for you.

the one on the left is the 3861 sapphire sandwich oem 16mm clasp and leather strap 20mm tapering to 16mm

the two to the right are for other models but all do fit the speedmaster 3861 watch - 20mm tapering to 18mm though which a lot of people i guess are moving away from (but which i prefer personally)

2535.80.00, one of the first co-axials out there. it just stopped working at random times. took it to the local ad and got it back a few weeks later, no explanation. my brother had the exact same problem with his shortly after that, precisely same watch.


then there was the aqua terra i got for my second brother. within a few months tje minutes hand came loose.
same thing happened to my other brother's seamaster 2223.80. in both cases the ad took them in and did the repair in a day and again didn't gave any paperwork. 


all 4 watches were so called ""soldier watches"". back in the 00s, the company that ran the px in danish military bases abroad was an omega ad, however they offered the watches at a steep discount, first of all there was not danish vat which is 25% and then they offered a 10 to 15% discount on top of that.
needles to say, i got myself a bunch of watches back then, and purchased additional ones from my brothers. 
 ads in denmark were really not happy about them, so they would perform any repairs or adjustments under guarantee, but would do so in the least friendly manner they could, i can't remember getting much paperwork after the repair of the hands. 


the last  one was not a new watch but a new movement on my wife's seamaster 120m (quartz). they changed the full movement and after a few months it started loosing time. small bumps will get it to stop. i took it to some local watchmaker (non-ad) as she didn't want to wait. they said it was something with the battery contact, and it seems to be running ok since then. call it 4 new watches and a new movement. ",2024-12-26 21:03:31

don’t get me wrong, the speedy is great but the white dial, with the lacquered dial and applied indices wears a lot more dressier than a hesalite black dial.

Sebanff,speedmaster,"(nzl32 owner here) sorry to see that. unfortunately, you're spot on the 3602 and its bubois-depraz chrono-module. its is probably a small adjustment, but certified watchmakers can't get any separate parts of this module as omega only provide standard exchange of all chrono-parts. same hell as speedmaster reduced....

so there are two ways:

1) send it back to a certified, but they will charge full service and might send it back to switzerland (based of here you are)

2) try to find a non-certified who is willing to work on it. it is touchy bcoz the architecture of this chrono is completely different that what they used to see (eta7750-style chrono). and it might end-up they will just remove and reposition the hand at 0 without resolving the underlying issue.",2024-12-22 10:33:55
Glittering_Cup_5426,speedmaster,"depends on how well you get on with your watchmaker. the hand is not that expensive, and if your technician doesn‘t want to give you a complete service (what they sometimes do, for warranty reasons) it shouldn be that expensive (about 100 usd?) i can‘t tell you from my experience, my speedmaster was repaired free of charge because it had been serviced shortly before, so there still was a warranty.

japanese consumers culture is very different to the west. the japanese always want the latest thing. if you are a generation behind the current you have less status. as a result the used market in japan has too many sellers and not enough buyers . even if a watch is still great but old it holds less value than the current production model in the minds of the japanese watch nerds.

there is an entire industry in japan that revolves around the marketing and sale of used luxury goods to foreign buyers online. the scale of their inventories scares me.

the japanese involved in this industry know the value of true vintage grail pieces in the west but it’s the vast catalogue of neo-vintage where this market shines. if your wrist is smaller than 7” this is your heaven. they have mid sized references you’ve probably never seen before and stupid low prices, especially as the yen is weak against the us dollar right now.

often when a model is deleted from the current collection networks of ad’s pool their deleted stock and sell it to these resellers in bulk on the condition they can’t sell to japanese residents. want a railmaster? japan has them nos with warranty. seamasters galore.

Bridge_Too_Far,speedmaster,"if you’re okay with neo-vintage some of the best omegas made have come from the period. 1998-2010. if you want blue try a seamaster professional in either steel or titanium.

for reference here is my titanium seamaster 2231.80 with electric blue dial from 2006. as an indication i imported this from japan back in september for the equivalent of approximately $2,300usd. came with omega rubber strap and titanium bracelet.

these are 41mm but there were steel variants made in 36mm too if your wrist is on the smaller side.

a blue colourway is usually something omega does well in the seamaster collection. it is a popular colour so there are many options. someone else posted a blue dial railmaster which would be a good buy. 40mm no date with a real explorer vibe but with 15k gauss resistance (which you won’t get on the rolex) .

looking for blue in the speedmaster collection will unfortunately add a premium. you can however find speedmaster day/dates with the chrono subdials at 12, 6 and 9 in blue. again japan is your best market for those, should be under $2k there.

for reference here is my titanium seamaster 2231.80 with electric blue dial from 2006. as an indication i imported this from japan back in september for the equivalent of approximately $2,300usd. came with omega rubber strap and titanium bracelet.

these are 41mm but there were steel variants made in 36mm too if your wrist is on the smaller side.

a blue colourway is usually something omega does well in the seamaster collection. it is a popular colour so there are many options. someone else posted a blue dial railmaster which would be a good buy. 40mm no date with a real explorer vibe but with 15k gauss resistance (which you won’t get on the rolex) .

looking for blue in the speedmaster collection will unfortunately add a premium. you can however find speedmaster day/dates with the chrono subdials at 12, 6 and 9 in blue. again japan is your best market for those, should be under $2k there.

i think if you already have a datejust, the aqua terra would be more or less a similar overlap as a dressy style diver.

but, as a more serious and measured response- what are you going to be doing while wearing it? it's not required, but it's *nice* to have a metal bracelet or rubber strap as an option for a daily watch. the cartier is a good office watch and getting drinks after work watch, but perhaps not something i'd expect (especially on leather) to see on someone's wrist at the lake or beach or hiking through the woods. the seamaster can do *all* of those things, but it doesn't have the slightly ritzy refined edge; it's a rougher refinement. 

  
there are no wrong answers here, your personal style should take precedent. but if it were me, i would look at a range of omega seamasters and try to find one that is a ""best fit.""",2025-02-14 04:18:53

1. incredibly accurate and durable movement - mine runs +5 seconds a month. that's +0.16 spd! anti-magnetic as well.
2. relatively ""cheap"" on the secondary market (compared to msrp)
3. true gada watch, works with almost any outfit for any occasion
4. the looks - you either love it or you don't. i think it's pure class!
5. not ubiquitous - speedmasters/ats/smps are a dime a dozen
6. intricate dial! love how the pie pan dial plays with the light and you get all kinds of variation of blue
7. cool see through caseback design
8. wears well and looks great on either the bracelet or strap
9. jumping hour hand makes it a great travel watch, anti-magnetic as well so no worries walking through metal detectors

cons:

1. no screw down crown
2. small crown and the lack of it popping out makes it a bit hard to wind
3. doesn't hold resale value well if you bought it new
4. no micro adjust on bracelet

it's an awesome watch! i would absolutely buy it again if i didn't have it in my collection for some reason.

but of course it’s all just personal taste. if this watch hits right for you, then who cares what i think. any omega is a great watch.",2024-10-24 15:12:21

Calm_Shift865,seamaster,"ok, for omega watches if the back is stainless steel and the front is gold then the watch is probably just plated. but when the back is all gold then 95% of the time it is all gold. but sometimes the front and back could be plated as well. now whether your particular watch is worth a lot of money, well first of all everyone defines a lot of money differently.  if your watch is truly 18k gold it will be worth more than the same watch in stainless steel or gold plated. but it is the rarity and the condition of a watch that makes it collectible. and the collectibility will define whether your watch is worth a lot of money. my guess and i am not a pro… somewhere between $1,000 to $2,000. and since it has not been serviced you are looking at the lower end. another possibility to have value added to this watch is if your grand father also saved the original box and papers from his purchase. that usually add about 20%-25%. but do not take my advice, take it to a pro.

so there is one more “value” to your watch and that would be a “sentimental value”.

did you know your grand father? if you did, did  you have a good relationship with him or not? was he a good man? do you have anything else from him? it may mean something to you or it may mean absolutely nothing to you.

for me, i hold sentimental value as an important part of the equation when it comes to things like this.  i would not sell this watch, i would get it looking and working as best as i could through omega only not just some jewelry repair shop.

other considerations might be if one has more of these than the other:

\- original buckle?

\- original crown?

\- original dial?

but metal bracelets i can at least see the extra cost: you’ve got tighter tolerances, sharper edges, etc. even just looking at the uncle bracelet vs my speedy oem i can see the quality difference. 

rubber for me is a weird one. i went with the oem seamaster rubber strap and deployant and i love it. i generally dislike fkm, so it’s far better than any third party fkm strap, but may be of similar quality to third party non fkm rubber - i haven’t tried any so can’t say for sure. 

but for a metal bracelet, especially a 5 link one like the speedy, i can at least see why it costs so much more. whether that’s worth it or not to you is totally subjective. it very well could not be, like i said, i definitely like a nice bracelet and can feel the quality difference, but if you can’t then that’s better for you! you get to save money and i don’t lol!",2025-03-18 19:57:57

xenc23,seamaster,"good question. i’d say the factors to consider:
- how much you want a speedy vs the smp you’d consider
- would you get a used speedy instead? (you can get a used speedy for new retail smp price)
- if you waited, how long until you’d have saved want you want?
- do you anticipate or want to add more later? (this can be a hard question.)
- what other watches do you own?

i would say if you strongly prefer the speedy -or- you expect this to be your only watch in this price range (or only one for a while), wait to get the speedy. 

i love the smps but i think the speedy is much more versatile. the nttd and the newer titanium seamasters are awesome but don’t help you here since pricier than a speedy!

a big pro of the smp though is it can be a gada daily watch, notably very comfortable for beach/pool/swimming. most people won’t do that with their speedy (even though you can if it’s new). the smp doesn’t make for a great dress watch though (base models on rubber).

of the three they're all great and all different.  i own an at and i love it but it's not a chronograph.  i owned a moon watch and i actually sold it, i didn't love it, the black dial did nothing for me.  it was one of those ""buy it because that's what you're supposed to do purchases"".  

you have to figure out what works for you. 

but ultimately for me i'd choose between the at and the white dial speedmaster.  today i'd get the speedy but that's because i already own an at.",2025-04-20 01:58:16
sgtdag,speedmaster,"a reduced is perfectly doable if you’re comfortable with an automatic movement speedmaster. i own the triple date, and while it’s not technically a reduced model, its similarly smaller size works well on my 6.5” wrist.

imo the issues bout the movement are overblown. i’m not hearing much to think that the movement is any less reliable. for servicing, omega charges the same for this as for the speedmaster pro. some independents won’t service this, but some will. any watch of this vintage is likely overdue for servicing unless you can confirm it has been recently serviced.

AutomaticReviews,speedmaster,"i’ve worn my hesalite lot, and it has barely any scratches (only visible when you hold it at a specific angle) despite dinging the crystal a bunch of times. even then you can remove them. in general, it looks a lot better, but you would have to be somewhat more mindful if you’re usually very rough on watches. that said if something can scratch hesalite it’s likely to be able to scratch the aluminum bezel or even the metal case. hesalite scratches easily relative to sapphire but most things which *really* scratch it in the real world are things that would scratch almost anything except sapphire.

another point i’d make is when i see a speedmaster some light marks on the crystal i actually like it. the appeal of this watch is almost entirely due to its vintage/adventurous origins. we get so caught up trying to keep everything perfect we sometimes forget how damn sexy imperfections can be. that said, i dislike watches which only offer mineral glass because it’s the worst of both worlds. not that scratch resistant, and not repairable, if you got a scratch that really annoyed you. though thr last part doesn’t pertain to speedmasters.",2025-04-15 13:10:42

frataliens,seamaster,i’m late to the thread but will give my two cents. i live in a very hot climate and go to the pool/beach all the time. i like being able to wear my watch in the water with no concerns so i went for a seamaster. i also cook a lot and use the dive bezel to remind me when to take things off the grill. that’s just me and what i have found it works best for. you buy what you want.,2025-01-20 19:26:39

HK_Ootoot,speedmaster,i feel like almost every week there’s a post about whether the speedmaster is too large. it’s all about perception since the speedy has such a large dial. i used to think that to about how it fit on my 7” wrist but the short lug to lug makes it so that it doesn’t look to large for most wrists.,2024-11-13 18:20:47

Lovethosebeanz,speedmaster,"looks great. 

although i had a speedmaster for 7 years and always thought it was too big and eventually sold it. if you think it’s too big, it is in your mind and will. if you whole time you have it. 

i sold mine and got a 36mm explorer instead",2024-11-14 09:39:08
Fishmongerel,speedmaster,"https://preview.redd.it/ztt35ms0cn0e1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1f1cbe7e5802977e20fe5ce598d7d4e73f0b18fb

the movement is well worth the admission price, as are the tactiles: pusher feel and engagement detent is excellent, hand winding is sublime.  the clarity of the ar is as good as it gets, the galvanised dial press rather than the usual lacquer allows for finer detail under macro, it really is phenomenal.  polishing and finish overall is a noticeable cut above the 3861 and trilogy, with some really beautiful mirrored curves under the bezel and contrasting soft, fine satin brushing elsewhere.

the restraint applied to this recreation in dial text and case back information speaks class, the whole watch does, really.  bracelet is gorgeous, light and comfortable- you won’t be able to get a sense of how light reflects off the watch and bracelet until you see it out in the sun.  it’s a great looking watch.  i often dress mine down on a nato and only one person has ever picked that it’s an ed white, and that was a fellow speedmaster nerd.

lume is brilliant for a chronograph, still legible at 5am for my early coffee runs.

it’s the ultimate speedy for me, definitely not going anywhere from the collection, buy one if you can!",2024-11-13 10:45:29
AwardExcellent1153,speedmaster,"honestly that watch makes no sense to me.

it’s a remake of the first watch used during a space walk.

not the first speedmaster, not the first omega in space, not the watch that went to the moon.

it’s a “generic” older speedmaster with a 321 in it.

the most important speedmaster is the 105.012, which is aesthetically similar to the newer moonwatch models, but has a 321 in it as well.

if you have a speedmaster grail, that should be the 105.012.

the only one in omega’s current collection that truly makes sense is the 3861 imo, it being the natural evolution of the original moon watch makes it coherent with its own history and heritage.

everything else is basically a collectible for the speedmaster collector that already owns a few speedmasters.",2024-11-16 03:50:32
Iambowlzy,speedmaster,i’ll say omega speedmaster 376.0822,2024-11-13 08:54:04
DogEffective5609,speedmaster,"it is actually my grail watch too. i was happy to buy it this year after nearly 3 years waiting and once i have this watch on hand, i can see all other steel watches inferior to this (this is very subjective btw and no offence). i think it is what a grail watch means - finding the one watch you believe it’s the best.

the whole execution is gorgeous. for an ultimate watch, we go for either the newest design/tech or the most og one. this reissue of calibre 321 combine the og movement and modern case and bracelet. can’t think of any better speedmaster in steel, even the silver snoopy (again it’s subjective;)",2024-11-15 06:43:36
datlat24,speedmaster,what is the difference between this and a regular speedmaster professional?,2024-11-13 08:22:07
blake_ch,speedmaster,"the biggest change is the movement. the regular moonwatch (current version) uses the omega 3861, which is a modern and metas certified. the watch here uses the caliber 321, which is the ""og"" speedmaster movement back in the 50s-60s and is the one that ""made it"" first to the moon, before omega switches the production to the caliber 861 (which later evolved into the 1861 and the 3861 we know now).

compared to the 3861, the 321 is still assembled by hand, which limits its production rate and increases the price. the 321 is less accurate (average daily rate) than the recent calibers, but has a lot of history in it, is assembled by hand. it also uses a column wheel for the chronograph (x861 all use a cam).

but these are all things that happen ""inside"" the watch. visually, this edition  uses some codes of the speedmaster of its time, with the smaller case (39.7mm because it has no crown guard) and bracelet.",2024-11-13 09:03:13
blake_ch,speedmaster,"there have been several watches used by the nasa.

prior to nasa mission, omega had the ck2915 speedmaster, which used broad arrows. which is now re-issued as part of the heritage lineup ('57 broad arrow).

then omega releases the ck2998, which had sword hands, and was used by the nasa. therefore is now omega releasing re-editions of that design as the ""first omega in space"" (space, not moon!)

there is a period where you find the ""smaller"" case and new hands, such as picture in the ed white heritage model. but it didn't make it to the moon.

only later did omega create the professional line and the asymmetrical case (for the crown guard). which a few models and years later made it to the moon and became really ""the moonwatch "".

astronauts who landed on the moon all used various speedmaster references. buzz aldrin had a 105.012. the 145.012 is also a well-know, and finally the 105.003. these would be the ""real"" moonwatches.

despite the look evolving, they all featured the caliber 321, even  though the caliber 861 was already in production.

to sum up, it all depends which part of the history you like and want to celebrate.",2024-11-13 11:02:33
IAmAHorseSizedDuck,speedmaster,"the omega reference numbers actually make sense if you know how to read them. its.. collection, case material and bracelet/strap, case diameter, movement type, dial colour, sequence.

so..
310 - speedmaster

30 - stainless steel & bracelet

40 - 40mm

50 - coaxial chrono, 0 added complications 

06 - grey dial

AggressiveChannel687,speedmaster,not sure why it wouldn’t be considered a moonwatch.  i own multiple speedmaster pro watches and this is by far one of the better ones. there is nothing cheap or knock off about it imo. and isn’t the point of the fois to actually mimic the first watch in space? this is nothing like a moonswatch either. and the white dial speedy is cool but they really missed the opportunity to make it great by making the bezel aluminum. complete fumble in my opinion,2024-11-12 18:31:05

Bridge_Too_Far,seamaster,"because it’s the largest market for luxury watches in the world. japan is a megabeast that can’t stop consuming luxury goods. it’s also a market that culturally does not value used items. once something there is no longer considered new (or the current model) it is aggressively priced down to move. 

i recently found a dealer in japan who had large stocks of seamaster heritage 300’s in steel & yellow gold. brand new, box and papers and they stamp the warranty card upon purchase for 5 years of factory warranty for the equivalent of $4.5k usd.

another thing to note about buying in japan is that any business wanting to sell used goods must be licensed by their local division of public safety (police). operating without the approval of their local police is highly frowned upon and most japanese dealers will not take the risk of not being licensed. i’ve bought multiple pieces from japan and have done so with absolute confidence. japanese dealers also tend to underrepresent the quality ratings of their inventory.",2024-11-08 20:56:36

but the first thing you have to do when you get a moonswatch is throw that damn strap in the garbage or stuff it in the box and toss it in your closet. it’s the worst part of the watch, it’s an utter piece of garbage, and the only aspect of the moonswatch (in my opinion) that deserves the hatred that’s heaped on these things.",2024-10-30 11:26:27

other swatch chronographs cost $190… a moonswatch cost $260. if you like the swatch brand and you’re content with their quality to price ratio… you’re only paying a $80 premium for the speedmaster design and the omega co-branding.

No-Treacle-505,aqua terra,"it really is beautiful and a watch is an emotional purchase as much as it is a logical one! 

if you were putting rationale in to your decision i suppose you have to consider in which scenarios you will be using it, what you want it to do and take it from there....

my daily is a tudor black bay pro.   i travel for work so have use for the gmt function and my work wardrobe is smart casual so it fits just fine in that environment.   i swim, climb and hike in my spare time so the black bay pro was absolutely perfect for me.  i love the way it looks and wears.    on the occasions i have a cuff on or am getting dressed up i generally wear my dress watch which is a longines dolce vita sector dial which i think is absolutely gorgeous.  

a daily watch for me has to have a date.  it has to be rugged enough to do the stuff i do. it has to suit my wardrobe and i have to absolutely love the way it looks if i'm spending a serious amount of money on it.

if i wanted a watch that covered all these scenarios i would choose the aqua terra",2024-10-12 20:57:41
No-Treacle-505,aqua terra,"it is a classic, in fact i'd say it's my absolute favourite chrono by a country mile. it's absolutely gorgeous and i'd love to own the white dial speedie......as part of a collection.

i don't think it's something i'd want to get wet full stop.  i know tons of people swim in it but i also know loads of people don't due to issues with water ingress, condensation etc.  it also doesn't have a date which for me is important as a daily watch. the aqua terra would look far better with a cuff in my opinion and i can confidently take it swimming.  for these reasons the speedie can't be my one and done watch as i'm gonna need another watch for those scenarios",2024-10-12 20:34:27

HosnianPrime808,speedmaster,"this is my opinion as a 30+ year collector.

i've owned probably at least 6 different seamasters. they are all different as omega changes their whim every few years. there is nothing wrong with that but the speedmaster is an instant ""design classic"". google that term if you want. there are only a few products bestowed with that honor. and that honor takes literally decades to cement. that pedigree is earned through the changing tides of time itself.

like an eames lounge chair, a barbour bedale coat, or a pair of black rayban wayfarers. you simply do not know what year it came from. sure, there are little nuances here but i can tell you this. i have pictures of me 30 years ago with a pair of white tee shirt and blue jeans along with a speedmaster pro, and no one would know if it was year 1996, 2001, 2005, 2010, 2016, or 2024. it literally transcends decades. go back 40 more years, and there is a pict of my own dad with tee shirts, jeans, and a speedy and you could not tell if it was the era of the swinging 60s, the disco 70s, the punk 1980s, or emo 1990s. i look like my own dad and if you saw a picture taken in 1970, you wouldn't know if it was him or me. sitting on an eames chair, wearing a pair of black raybans and sporting a speedmaster, my own son who is 16 will be wearing mine for the next 30 years. and in the year 2040 or 2050, someone could look at a photo and wonder if it was him, me, or his granddad. you could not date when the photograph was taken. there is nothing to give you a clue.

>a **design classic** is an industrially manufactured object with timeless aesthetic value. it serves as a standard of its kind and remains up to date regardless of the year of its design. 

that is a design classic. the seamaster my dad had in 1970 is different than the one i had in 1990s and different from the one i got in 2020. very few watches are in the pantheon of design classics. the submariner, patek calatrava, jlc reverso, and omega speedmaster.",2024-10-11 03:21:08

-99 percent of people don't care what watch you wear with a suit, these days any watch that isn't a smartwatch is often considered dressy. there is a small group of people that feel there should be hard rules for what you wear when and how, but perhaps they forget that prince william has been wearing the same omega seamaster professional for 30 years with pretty much any outfit... and it looks great. i realize you aren't prince william, but you are buying this watch for yourself for the completion of your phd, doesn't that trump what any person online has to say?

Flashy-Tonight-45,speedmaster,"i think you have sort of answered your own question here. i’m an omega fan and while i appreciate the speedmaster and owned one for a while, it isn’t the watch for me. 

1.) the water resistance is poor 
2.) servicing is more expensive as it is a chrono with a more complex movement and pushers

meatatarian,speedmaster,"if you regularly plan on swimming with the watch, i'd get a seamaster. a speedmaster can be used for occasional swimming but that's not really what it's designed for. the seamaster has a more adjustable and wider bracelet that makes it a bit more comfortable and adjustable for water activities. the speedmaster bracelet is comfortable but thin and isn't great for intense actitiy imo since it can dig into the wrist a bit. 

the speedmaster 57 and seamaster both have a bit more ""presence"" and size on the wrist than the speedmaster, which wears small for it's size. all of the watches will be heavy for extreme activities or long distance paddling. seamaster is noticeably heavier than the speedmaster.

omega say the speedmaster pro is waterproof to 50 metres because they’ve tested it beyond that. if you sink that deep when you fall into a lake, you’ve got bigger things to worry about than your watch. 
as a well-respected omega certified watchmaker active on several forums often says, “it’s watertight until it isn’t”.

meatatarian,speedmaster,"i never mentioned depth rating since both of them are fine for almost anything. it's a bigger deal that the speedmaster bracelet is simply not as a comfortable or adjustable with certain vigorous activities, which is why i highlighted it.

then there is the fact that seal failure is a probabilistic event. the speedmaster has more seals that can fail and it is not rated to the same extreme depth. a seal partially or fully failing such that water depth rating is compromised is more likely over time. this is less important if you are getting your watch regularly serviced and tested, but really, what percent of owners pressure tests their watches every year?",2024-10-12 22:33:16

edit:

""curiously, omega only learned about the speedmaster’s journey into space after seeing a photograph of ed white taken during america’s first spacewalk as part of the gemini 4 mission in june of 1965. the watch was attached to the arm via a long nylon strap secured with velcro.

following the discovery, omega decided to add the word ""professional"" to the product name, thus becoming omega speedmaster professional. the new reference number was 145.012.""",2024-08-12 18:05:24

Nerazzurro9,seamaster,"while you obviously want to avoid the whole high-end-watch-guy mentality of “what should i buy my ad’s son for his bar mitzvah that might move me up the list without seeming too desperate…” there is something to be said for knowing an ad in your area and being generally friendly with them. there’s a guy in my area who i’ve bought a hamilton and a couple odd watch straps from over the years, and he’ll do minor repairs for me for free. he recently called me with a heads-up that he’d just gotten a good condition electric blue seamaster in, because i’d told him i was a fan of those. he once subtly talked me out of buying a watch he had for sale (“honestly, for that price you could do better, but these have been selling well recently, so…”). i don’t think we’re actual friends or anything, but i know he wouldn’t rip me and would be willing to make a deal, and that’s a good thing to have.

blursed_child76,speedmaster,"i’m someone who purchased a speedmaster (and smp300) through omega online. yes, i paid full price for both (though 2021/2022 prices). 

i consider myself highly introverted. i don’t necessarily think it’s better to buy online versus in person, but i don’t really enjoy in person purchases. it’s 100% a personal thing.

going in, i had already tried on both watches a while back, and knew they were what i wanted. the downside to buying online is that you lose the opportunity to compare to other watches. honestly, i have only ever had one watch that i bought that didn’t work out, but it was low cost, and i was able to sell it for what i bought it for. had i explored in person, i could have tried on several watches, and realized what i thought i wanted was not going to work out. when you’re talking about a $5k+ purchase, it’s trickier if you only do it online.

i could have gone with an authorized reseller online, but none of them were offering any discounts—felt like going through omega directly made sense in that case. i was okay spending more to avoid the store, but if you can snag a discount at an ad and don’t mind in person, 100% go that route. in the end, they’re the same watch.",2024-08-09 14:51:31

i only looked for the 1863 hesalite sandwich because i had to have the plastic crystal with a display back and voila...

""it also uses a higher beat rate than the 321, which is 21,600vph versus 18,000vph. the 861 was more accurate, and also cheaper to produce. in 1997, omega updated the speedmaster professional moonwatch reference 3570.50 with a new movement, caliber 1861. this movement is the same as the last iteration of the 861 (as said, there are a few) but with a rhodium-plated finish. older caliber 861 iterations had one jewel less, and even older ones had a copper-plated finish.""

from omega's site:
