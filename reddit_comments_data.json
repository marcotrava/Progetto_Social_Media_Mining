        "text": "thanks it is the halo piece of my collection and i adore it. particularly because it would have been made on or around my birth year. it\u2019s the most perfect dial i\u2019ve seen. i don\u2019t know the history unfortunately but it appears to have spent much of the last 50 years in a drawer. the tritium is entering its 5th half-life so its radioactivity is almost completely depleted and doesn\u2019t glow at all at this point which is what you would expect at this age. glow would indicate relume at some point so no glow is good. the tritium on the hands match the dial perfectly so my guess is that both are original. lots of drsds have had clasps and bracelets replaced in the 90\u2019s or early 2000\u2019s but this one has all original matching and correct part numbers for end links, bracelet, and clasp. the bracelet has little to no stretch and is in incredible condition. it\u2019s impossible to know if the superdome crystal has been replaced but it\u2019s in great condition and slightly cloudy indicating some age but no visible deep scratches. the 1665 superdome crystal is acrylic and very very thick to achieve what was at the time (and still is to some extent) an incredible depth rating. this is the first rolex with a gas escape value. submariner crystals were popping off due to internal gas pressure building during the decompression process. the dsrd was the solution. the case back is also correct. the crown happens to line up almost perfectly upright, a nice bonus. the bezel insert and dial fade are identical giving me hope that the bezel insert is original as well. i\u2019m not a bezel expert like some collectors but this one has the correct fat font and serif features on the 5 that is sometimes lost upon later replacement. there is no obvious over polishing but i would assume that at some point it was polished lightly but you can clearly see the chamfered edges of the case so anything that may have been done was minimal. immediately before i acquired it, it was serviced by rolex so i know it\u2019s 100% authentic. the only thing it lacks is that deep pumpkin patina which according to the tritium nerds out there requires years of exposure to sunlight. this watch probably was not worn enough to get that for better or worse. :)",

        "text": "i've had the current-gen black sub-date and bluesy, as well as the 39.5mm blue seaq on a bracelet. each has its pros and cons. you've already had a submariner, so, i'll just give you my perspective on the seaq from a sub owner.\n\nfirst, have you tried on the seaq? if you haven't, i'd really encourage you to do so. (i can't tell if the second pic is your wrist or stock images) it wears significantly thinner and more comfortably than the 41mm submariner. one cool thing about the seaq i don't see mentioned anywhere is that even though it's a smaller watch than the sub, the dial itself is larger (or equally large), with a doomed sapphire crystal and a thinner bezel, which means that visually, when reading the time or just admiring the dial/applied indices, it's easier imo.\n\nspeaking of which, the dial and indices are amazing. just perfect. it's a little funky chicken with the 2/4/6/8/10/12, but that's what's fun about it. as i mentioned, i have the blue dial which is a beautiful sunburst (one of the best there is, imo), but the green is a flat slightly textured surface, so will have a different effect.\n\nthe seaq has been my pick for travel over the sub. as you've probably picked up on, rolex attracts more attention. i've traveled to many places without a care in the world with my seaq. i have the pcl bracelet, which i actually think matches the elevated personality of the watch, but if i were ever in an area of concern, i'd throw it on a rubber or nylon strap. go sells their own high-quality versions of these with deployment clasps, but they're not cheap. i found a grey nylon that scratched that itch for 1/10th the price.\n\nfinishing on the seaq is really next-level. rolex is great, too, but it's like comparing an 8/10 to a 10/10.  go now allows you to order (or replace existing models) a see-through instead of the solid caseback. i actually love the solid caseback on mine and am undecided on whether to swap it for sapphire.\n\nand of course it has the absolute best adjustment system in the business. perfect fit every time, don't even have to take the watch off your wrist to adjust. literally the best. i daily a pepsi on jubilee, and while the jubilee is more comfortable, i do hope rolex eventually offers an adjustment system like what go has. \n\ndownsides to the seaq include lack of value retention.... if you go seaq, make sure you buy one with a hefty discount. i got a full set that was about 3 months old on the bracelet for about 6k. you can do the math on how much you'd lose should you be the sucker who pays retail.\n\napparently there's less magnetic resistance. again, i've had no problems during lots of travel.\n\nand, for whatever it's worth, the \"non watch people\" in my life don't like the seaq. whenever i complain to the wife that i have too many watches and need to sell something, she always recommends i sell the seaq lol.\n\n  \nall in all, it's a beautiful watch that's perfectly proportioned and finished. it's really an \"inside baseball\" piece, and is very unlikely to attract attention - both good and bad, while traveling. i still own the seaq /bluesy, but have moved on from my black sub.\n\nalright, now i'm off to a pool party. you know what i'm strapping on \ud83d\ude0e",

        "text": "great question. here is my personal take on it. \n\ni was looking for a gmt as well. i prefer the vintage looking than the newer one. \n\nnow i choose the 16710 over a 1984 birth year as well for these reasons:\n\n- i wanted to have an ind\u00e9pendant gmt hand over quick set date. the hour hand moves so fast( minute hand doesnt move while changing date if you want just the hour hand )  that changing the date is quick and easy, not like some make it sound that you have to wind and wind and wind the hour hand.. also, that is personal but i did not want to have to turn the bezel and not having it unaligned, maybe my ocd, but bezel looks good on 12 o\u2019clock. i track 2 time zone all the time so i want to have my bezel straight :) older models don\u2019t have ind\u00e9pendant gmt hand so anytime you want to track two time zones the bezel has to be rotated. \n\ni wanted to have a no hole case and solid end links. makes it more solid imo and doesn\u2019t rattle as much. \n\nacrylic glass looks nice and vintage but i preferred sapphire crystal for its robustness. \n\ni wanted to be able to use the super luminova if need be. not dropping 10k+ on a piece and have half its functions ( figure of speech) \n\nhappy with the 3185 movement. \n\ni do not regret it at all!!!!! bought it from jacek tropicalwatch: and it looked brand new, factory polish , papers and haven\u2019t taken it off since. \n\ni hope this helps, a lot of it is a matter of preference. \n\nlet us know what you go for or if you have any questions.",

        "text": "i took possession of this rolex submariner 16800 this week. my good friend of 7 years is an older gentlemen whom is a collector, and when he offered to pass it along to me, i couldn't resist.\n\ngetting this was a milestone for me that was symbolic for me as well. i first got into watches at 21 when i was in the army. a colleague showed a cheap fossil brand skeleton watch that i fell in love with at the time, and then when i got it myself i started going down the rabbit hole. during this time, i met a local gentleman through a masonic lodge and he was into watches, and i learned a ton about the actual luxury watch market through osmosis. i later purchsed an skx and rocked that for a few years.\n\nafter i transferred to a top 3 private university in the us, i got an omega po first generation (ref 2200.50.00) to celebrate struggling through my first year in school and coming out of my first internship at a big name hedge fund that i networked myself into. i rocked that throughout school. i had come out of a legitimately hard year. i lived in isolation during covid, lost a good friend to suicide, and failed my first classes when i first came in. when i got the po the following summer, it seemd appropriate.\n\ni graduated this year and although i had interned for 3 years, i decided not to join the fund due to it restructuring and me not really seeing upward potential as an analyst. the other leads i was pursuing my senior year didn't seem to have the timing right. i graduated without a clear idea of what i was doing; i knew what i was interested in but monetizing it on the open market was proving troublesome. for a few months, i would wake up every morning feeling terrible, go to the coffee shop, \"work,\" rinse and repeat. i kicked myself for not doing the traditional recruiting that college students go through. i had wanted to focus on my research projects (got published too as an undergrad) and was counting on there being something in my network that would bring me on. for months, it seemed my calculus had failed.\n\nduring the summer, my friend let me borrow the watch for some high profile local public events i was attending and i fell in love with how the sub mastered its proportions and was so versatile with outfits. when i first started collecting, i would remark (and he'd agree) that rolexes were worn by those that didn't have exposure to \"real\" watchmakers' brands, was coasting off brand value, etc etc. but in the watch connesiuer's journey, rolex seems to be something that people return to because it just... works.\n\na couple months after graduation, i reconnected with one of my old bosses from the c suite at the fund, and he told me he wanted me to come work for him at a fund he joined. 5 months after graduate, i started working for him as his direct report as he resturctures the business. i think this all has been worth it. as my po served well in school and in my internships, i discussed this with my collector friend and we agreed that this transition deserved a new watch as well. it also was apparent that my po didn't fit as nicely underneath my shirt as a sub does. i'm still breaking into the job right now, but i love where i'm at in life. my friend sold me this watch to celebrate that transition and new job. i am fortunate that based on our 7 year friendship he is letting me pay in installments.\n\nhe himself got it with box and papers a decade ago in nyc. it is a 1980s sub with tritium dial that is long gone in terms of lume, but he got a watchmaker to stabilize the markers on the dial and on the hands so it'll stay in this condition for a long time.",

(and my marlin 1895 45-70.)  my favorite was a toss-up between that white-dialed f1 and the hamilton chrono.\n\nbut then i sort of fell out of watches.  partly because of my increasing work-from-home schedule, and partly because i bought an apple watch.  i bought it mainly for road biking, but i felt compelled to wear it all the time due to the sleep monitoring and all that.  it left no room for other watches, unless i was willing to dual-wield, which i was not.  i'm no nicholas hayek.\n\nso what's all this got to do with the watch in the pic?  well, i eventually came back around.  i was still 100% wfh, but i decided owning and wearing cool watches made me feel good, so i decided to take it all back up.",

        "text": "so i got my grail watch...now what?\n\ni have been wanting a polar explorer ii for as long as i have been into watches - 20 years or so.  but i couldn't bring myself to buy one because of the cost.  ironic, because i've certainly spent the 2005 cost of the watch over the course of my watch journey.  but it is what it is.\n\nmy first watches were departmet store fare back in the 80's.  also a timex ironman trialthlon.  a buddy and i had the same ironman and i remember us playing a game where we tried to start and stop the chronograph function as fast as possible, striving for that elusive \"0.01\" readout.\n\nmy first \"nice\" watch was a two-tone seiko kinetic...my ex and i bought matching ones.  i think they totaled about $500 back in 1997 or so.  i ended up with several seikos - mostly kinetics and a few titanium models.  i thought seikos were pretty neat.\n\nfast-forward to 2006, and my manager was into watches.  he was the first guy i had ever met that was into watches.  he had a couple of tudors and i can't remember what else.  i remember he had a white-faced tudor with \"tiger\" printed in red script i thought it was pretty cool although i could have done without the \"tiger\" on it as i didn't play golf.  funny enough i can't find a pic of it anywhere...i see pics of the prince but i don't remeber my manager's watch being a chronograph.  anyway, i decided to take the plunge into really nice watches and so i went 'round to my local high-pressure-sales jewelry store and bought a couple of tags - a cream-dialed link chronometer and a white-dialed f1.\n\ni continued my tag collecting with a couple of carrera chronos, an aquaracer, another f1 (black dial).  i also branched out and bought a hamilton jazzmaster chrono, a hamilton pan-europ, more seikos, and a smattering of other pieces.  including several g-shocks at one point.\n\nalong the way, i became aware of rolex.  i mean, i knew of rolex, but rolex to me had always meant datejust.  i didn't even know rolex had a \"sport\" line.  when i started checking them out i became smitten with the polar.  and i have been ever since.\n\nas i started taking note of what other folks were wearing, i noticed that if they were wearing a rolex sport watch it was always a black sub.  and i mean always.  this made me want the polar even more.  nobody had one!  nobody even seemed to have the black explorer ii.\n\nbut alas, the price!  with the money i had tied up in (mostly) tags, i couldn't see also shelling out for the polar, and for some reason i wasn't comfortable with selling my entire collection to afford it.  this truly puzzles me; i don't know if it was fear of the trying to sell my collection (getting ripped off by shady buyers, etc), or the distaste of the prospect of losing a bunch of money after having bought all my watches new, or both, or what.  whatever it was, i didn't end up making any sort of plan to buy the polar.\n\nwhat i did do is try to substitute this watch or that watch for the rolex.  i had an alpha and an invicta that resembled the polar, and i even went so far as to purchase a debaufre gmt ocean-2, which was a dead ringer.  but i rarely wore any of them, because i literally felt ashamed and like a big faker.\n\neventually i sold most of my watches (most of my rifles too) because i needed the money for actual life things.  let's say i was motivated, and so found a way to get over any mental blocks i had vis-a-vis selling watches on the bay.  i kept the tag f1's and the hamiltons and the g-shocks.  (and my marlin 1895 45-70.)  my favorite was a toss-up between that white-dialed f1 and the hamilton chrono.\n\nbut then i sort of fell out of watches.  partly because of my increasing work-from-home schedule, and partly because i bought an apple watch.  i bought it mainly for road biking, but i felt compelled to wear it all the time due to the sleep monitoring and all that.  it left no room for other watches, unless i was willing to dual-wield, which i was not.  i'm no nicholas hayek.\n\nso what's all this got to do with the watch in the pic?  well, i eventually came back around.  i was still 100% wfh, but i decided owning and wearing cool watches made me feel good, so i decided to take it all back up.",

        "text": "the sotc was grim.  the white-dialed f1 had damage to the crown guards.  the black-dialed one wouldn't run, despite a battery change.  half of the g-shocks were dead.  the only watch i got any joy out of wearing was the hamilton chrono, and it was illegible.  not that it had become that way suddenly or anything...it had always been.  silver hands, with no lume, on a silver dial don't make the most readabile of watches.  beautiful, but kinda hard on the eyes.  so i decided to sell it all...\n\n\n\n...and buy a grand seiko mist flake.\n\n\n\ndumb.\n\n\n\ni thought the mist flake would scratch the polar itch, and i had always loved spring drive, so i thought \"why not?\".\n\n\n\ndumb.  everybody says \"hold out for the one you want\".  i'm here to say that this advice is sound.\n\n\n\ni even went so far as to make up things in my mind as to why i didn't want or need to rolex.  \"i simply will not spend that kind of money on a watch - any watch.\"  \"i refuse to play the ad game.\"  \"i don't want to be a 'rolex guy'.\"  \"rolexes give off a certain vibe and it's not one i want.\"\n\n\n\nyeah, it was all bs head games.  after a couple months of owning the mist flake i still wanted the polar explorer ii just as bad as i ever did.  it all came to a head last saturday, when teddy dropped a video called \"why this rolex still impresses me after 6 years of ownership\".  i honestly didn't know what watch he'd be talking about (i didn't notice the damn thing in the thumbnail), so when he started talking about his polar i just kind of sat there with my jaw hanging open for a second.  no, really.  i thought it was some kind of sign.\n\n\n\nso discussed it with my wife, who simply said \"i don't see why you don't just buy the thing you want.\"  or exasperated words to that effect :-)\n\n\n\n3 days later, i had the watch.  bought it from bob's.  it is a nice box-and-papers piece from 1996.  i did some research and decided i liked the generation that was current when i first got into \"serious\" watches.  and like teddy, i wanted one with the lug holes.  i felt the 2 subsequent redesigns had given the watch a more luxurios air that was slightly off-putting, particularly the rolex branding around the rehaut.  also, i have small-ish wrists.\n\n\n\nso what now?  i have wanted this watch for so long, that having it feels...weird.  i guess i am surprised that it just feels like another watch.  i mean i love it and everything, but i guess i was expecting angels to sing or something.\n\n\n\nshortly after i bought the mist flake i half-heartedly started an \"all-seiko\" collection.  i bought a couple of solar chronos (ssc947 and ssc911) and a couple other gmts (ssk033 and ssk019). i think i'll keep the 911 and the 033 for variety.  and of course, the mist flake.  of my \"really nice\" watches, i consider the mist flake to be the \"dressy gmt\" and the polar to be the \"everyday gmt\".\n\n\n\nthank you for making it to the end of my dissertation on the rolex explorer ii, reference 16570, aka the \"polar\".",

(many watches though using eta gmt movements have a gmt hand jumping crown, which is stupid.)\n\ni have a couple of reasons for setting my gmt hand to actual gmt.  as both an airline pilot and private aircraft owner i fly a lot and everything aviation related is utc/zulu time.  second, if you go somewhere across the globe, having utc at a glance makes it easy to set the correct local time without needing to ask, see a clock, phone, or do the math of adding or subtracting your home/set time to get to utc time, then adding or subtracting that to get to local etc. you just need a little timezone map that shows utc+/-x where you are, glance at gmt hand and jump the hour + or - from the gmt hand.  if you don't have that for some reason, just take your longitude divided by 15, rounded to the nearest whole and *add* that number for east or *subtract* for west to get local time (might be off by one because of political borders etc).",

pretty anticlimactic, but enjoyable. i first visited an ad in december last year. they of course had nothing to sell me with a crown on it. i chit-chatted about watches and tried on a bunch of stuff, had a good rapport with the sales associate i was working with, put my name on the possibly imaginary waitlist for a couple pieces, and went on my way. it was a fun visit, and i had no expectations, so no harm done. since then, the sa has, to my surprise kept, in pretty regular contact with me and we've built up a bit of a regular cadence of checking in with each other. it started with him texting me random pieces he thought i'd be interested in. everything from seikos to carl f bucherer watches that cost as much as a rolex. he hasn't been pressuring me to buy them, just reaching out to me with things he finds interesting because him and i are both fans of watches beyond just rolex. did i buy anything from him since then? yes, absolutely. i know how the game works, and i'm playing it. i do have limits for myself though. i'm not buying anything i wouldn't otherwise buy, but i'm trying to give business to this ad when i can. i bought a tudor black bay ceramic i was genuinely interested they didn't have when i first visited, and 2 seiko watches and some earrings both for my wife. i know this seems like some forced purchases given i've only been at this since december, but my wife's birthday, christmas, and valentines day have all occurred over these few months, so it truly wasn't forced. i was actually offered one rolex, a datejust. it wasn't a crappy configuration either. it was the classic yellow gold fluted jubilee champagne dial iconic datejust, i just didn't want that to be my first purchase. i'm really hoping for a green bezel submariner, blue milgauss, or wimbledon datejust. again, i want specific things, and i'm not going to compromise just to get the first possible allocation. some people would tell me it was a huge mistake to turn down that datejust, but i don't believe it was. the sa said no big deal he wants me to get what i want he was just offering it to me for the sake of offering it to me because it unexpectedly became available after the person it was intended for backed out. we're still in regular contact and the latest purchase i made was only a couple weeks ago. i have no idea when i'll get allocated any of the specific pieces i actually want. i know the submariner is in very high demand, the milgauss isn't very high demand but it's also not produced in large quantities either, and the datejust is generally the easiest model to get but i'm looking for a very very specific configuration. \n\nthe one thing i'm not at all interested in, is the grey market. at this price point i don't even want to have to think about fakes and frankenwatches and all that crap. plus the more i see of the grey market the more skeezy it feels to me. i'm just not interested. not my scene. i know there are good grey market dealers out there, but there's just way too many guys whose entire business is firing off mass texts in whatsapp groups they paid for access to while acting like they're some kind of business tycoon who actually probably learned everything they know from tiktok. besides, what fun is buying the most hyped brand in the world if you're going to skip the entire hazing ritual that earns you the right to buy in?
